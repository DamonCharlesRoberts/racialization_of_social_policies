I'm 64 years old and have been aware of and interested in politics since I was I high school and Nixon was President and I have seen both Democrat and Republican Presidents come and go.

Furthermore, I believe we are in a constitutional crisis regarding all men being created equal and Trump has been and will always be racist and is not even pretending to unite our Nation around the pretext of black lives matter. He has a long history of being prejudice, what with the being sued and losing the charges of discriminating against renting to black folks as well as the Central Park 5 who were ultimately cleared of all charges but he advocated the death penalty for them and lets not even touch the Charlottesville Nazi's who killed the innocent black person who Trump referred to as good people on both sides.

How many types of constitutional crisis have you been hearing ""a lot of talk recently about"", and from whom? It seems to me there are several such issues. The greatest thing I sense is horror at how absolutely cataclysmically stupid and corrupt US politics have become. I thought Reagan was appallingly stupid and clearly not an actual president but a figurehead, and that that was obvious, as a teenager. G.W. Bush re-demonstrated that. Trump has just made it shockingly, appallingly evident that far too much of the American public, news media, and government representatives are either direly stupid, or incapable of critical thought, or some combination of ignorant, corrupt, cynical, delusional, or who knows what other cocktail of mental malfunctions, that this blatantly corrupt, sociopathic, incompetent evil clown/buffoon is actually supported and treated as a valid person by even 5% of the public. And yet, he's just another Reagan/Dubbya in terms of being a pawn/sacrifice for the oligarchic corruption that clearly owns most of our government. So, yeah, there's a constitutional crisis beyond that - several, in fact. The Citizens United ruling, the stacking of the Supreme Court, abortion rights, gun rights, and the crazy amount of abuse of office perpetrated by the Trump administration, the failure of Congress to properly impeach and eject the lying sleazebag even in the face of so many blatant abuses of the office.

1154539667.0,0.858247371401736,Board meetings only -- Very little community presence,de black treatment,Yes,"First, the healthcare system is so bad in this country that if I was faced with the choice of going to the hospital or dying, I would literally choose to die. Because the last time I had to go to a hospital for a life threatening emergency, it took me over 5 years to pay off my hospital bill for a 3-day stay (for the part my employer-based insurance didn't pay). In that time period, I was harassed by the hospital bill collectors on several occasions even though I had been making regular payments. Plus the hospital never sent me an itemized bill as I requested on three separate occasions. The financial stress is not worth it. Second, student loans are a weight around my neck. I am sure that I will never get them paid off, even after I reach retirement age. It is almost certain that I will die before they will ever be paid back. My oldest daughter is also in the same boat as I am and is in constant stress over her student loan debt. Third, the housing costs in my state have been growing absurdly sky high for years. I live paycheck to paycheck with very little savings, despite making what I think is a decent wage. If I had to move today, I would not be able to rent even a crappy apartment on the bad side of town. Rent would cost easily more than half to a third of my monthly wages (for even the cheapest apartment). I don't know how people are expected to live like this. High housing costs are one of the major factors causing the high rates of homelessness in Phoenix (my hometown). Fourth, cost of living on damn near everything else has gone up steadily over the past four years, especially since the Covid-19 crisis has hit. Now, I get scared and frustrated when I walk out of the grocery store with four grocery bags that cost me over $200. I'm cutting back, but there is not much left to trim from the budget. Fifth, my car died last year. The repair bill would have been $2000. I had already sunk $3000 into repair bills six months before that. There was no way I could justify another repair bill. So I scrapped it. I currently do not have a car and don't see how I could buy even a cheap used one right now, so I go without for now. Sixth, is credit card debt and their high interest rates. Slowly over the years I have amassed an uncomfortable amount of credit card debt. I would pay them down just to watch them go up again when an emergency hit (like car repair bills, broken water heater, etc.). Honestly, I pay more than the minimum almost every month, yet the amounts don't seem to be going down much at all. It is frustrating, for example, when you see something like $50 go towards the principal and $100 go to interest every month on a credit card payment. In closing, I live in a nice house, in a nice neighborhood, with my teenage daughter and my significant other. I still have a decent job when many people don't. But I am beyond worn out from the financial stress I face day in and day out, with no end in sight. The even worse thing about all of this, is that my grown children are not doing better than I am. They are actually financially worse off that I am, both now as well as when I was their age. I worry deeply about the life and world which my grandchildren will inherit. The American Dream is dead or a lie.

There are just two deeply conflicting political narratives in which both can't possibly be true.
