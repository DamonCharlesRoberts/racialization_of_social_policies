Project Code: BROW0009
Project Name: Election Study
Prepared for: Susan Moffitt
Interviews: 1000

YouGov interviewed 1100 respondents who were then matched down to a
sample of 1000 to produce the final dataset. The respondents were 
matched to a sampling frame on gender, age, race, and education. The 
frame was constructed by stratified sampling from the full 2018 American 
Community Survey (ACS) 1-year sample with selection within strata by weighted
sampling with replacements (using the person weights on the public use
file). 

The matched cases were weighted to the sampling frame using propensity
scores. The matched cases and the frame were combined and a logistic
regression was estimated for inclusion in the frame. The propensity
score function included age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, 
and region. The propensity scores were grouped into deciles of the 
estimated propensity score in the frame and post-stratified according to 
these deciles.

The weights were then post-stratified on 2016 Presidential vote choice, and 
a four-way stratification of gender, age (4-categories), race (4-
categories), and education (4-categories), to produce the final weight.
