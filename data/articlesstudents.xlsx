In a historic decision, Joe Biden has selected Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) as his running mate. Harris will be the first Black female Vice Presidential candidate on a major party ticket.

Student loans continue to be a major national issue, and the 2020 election may determine the future of existing student loan forgiveness programs, as well as broader debt cancellation proposals that have rapidly gained momentum in recent months. There is also speculation that Biden, if elected, may only serve one term, which means that Harris could have a shot at the presidency in just four years.

So where does Kamala Harris stand? Her positions has evolved over time, but she has voiced support for broad student loan forgiveness.

Kamala Harris: Past Student Loan Positions

When she served as California's Attorney General, Harris established herself as an early leader in the struggle to stop predatory for-profit schools from defrauding students. Her office sued one of the largest for-profit college chains in the nation — Corinthian Colleges — and she played a key role in bringing down the company, which allegedly saddled thousands of student loan borrowers with mountains of debt and limited career prospects. Harris has since been a strong proponent of Borrower Defense to Repayment, a program established to provide relief to student loan borrowers defrauded by their schools.

Harris has also supported initiatives for free college. She backed the College For All Act in 2017 (a bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders), and she co-sponsored the Debt-Free College Act of 2018, which would have created a federal-state partnership to incentivize states to reduce or eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities.

As a presidential candidate, Harris came out with her own student loan forgiveness plan. She proposed cancelling up to $20,000 in student loans for borrowers who established successful new businesses in underserved communities. However, the plan was criticized by some as being narrowly focused and unwieldy.

Kamala Harris: More Recent Positions on Student Loans

As recently as two weeks ago, Harris made public statements in support of broad student loan forgiveness. Publicly touting Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan, which supports investment in communities to achieve economic and racial justice, Harris voiced support for $10,000 in across-the-board student loan forgiveness for borrowers as a form of economic stimulus in response to the Coronavirus pandemic and the associated recession — a plan that is broadly supported by other Democratic senators.

Harris has also continued to reiterate support for the Borrower Defense to Repayment program, voting in favor of reversing new rules put in place by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that imposed new barriers for borrowers seeking relief. President Trump subsequently vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have restored the original Obama-era Borrower Defense rules.

Harris is a co-sponsor of the What You Can Do For Your Country Act, a bill that would substantially overhaul improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The bill would allow payments made under any repayment plan on both Direct and FFEL loans — not just income-driven plans or just Direct loans — to qualify for PSLF. And it would allow borrowers to get 50% of their loan balance forgiven after five years of public service work, with the remainder forgiven after the second five year period.

Harris has also called on the Senate to pass the HEROES Act, the $3.4 trillion stimulus bill passed by House Democrats in April. That bill would provide $10,000 in federal and private student loan forgiveness to economically distressed borrowers, and would extend the existing freeze on student loan payments and interest for a full 12 months. Senate Republicans have opposed that measure.

On Aug. 8, 2020, President Trump issued four administrative actions — one executive order and three memorandums — in response to the ongoing hardships that Americans are facing during the coronavirus pandemic. One of the three memos extends student loan payment deferment through the end of 2020.

This latest student loan payment relief memorandum, however, is not entirely the same as the aid under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Here’s what you need to know.

Key takeaways: What we know so far about the executive orders

Payments for federal student loans are deferred through Dec. 31, 2020.

Federal borrowers won’t have to pay interest during the extended deferment period.

Private student loan borrowers still won’t receive federal protections.

Payments that are deferred during this period likely won’t count toward loan forgiveness.

Federal loan payments are expected to restart on Jan. 1, 2021.

The memo is not an extension of the CARES Act

Some details of the memorandum include similar actions from the CARES Act, but there are also key differences.

The CARES Act, which was signed into law March 27, 2020, automatically suspends federal student loan payments through Sept. 30, 2020. It also states that, during this period, interest rate charges are set to 0 percent APR and won’t accrue on student loans owned by the U.S. Department of Education.

Borrowers who are pursuing federal loan forgiveness programs still receive credit during the suspension period under the CARES Act. To have paused payments credited toward their forgiveness payment count, borrowers must continue to meet other qualification requirements.

The latest memo issued by President Trump provides extended loan payment relief for federally owned student loans through Dec. 31, 2020, and waives interest charges during this time. However, there’s currently no language in the memorandum addressing whether borrowers working toward student loan forgiveness will still receive credit.

Whether the president has the legal authority to suspend interest on student loans without Congressional approval is still unclear.

How the president’s executive orders help federal student loan borrowers

The original federal student loan protections through the CARES Act are set to end on Sept. 30, so this extension gives borrowers with government-owned loans an extra three months of relief from making payments.

The U.S. unemployment rate is currently at 10.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Borrowers who’ve lost their jobs or experienced a reduction in pay due to COVID-19 can redirect funds that would’ve been used for federal student loan payments toward other essential needs, like housing and groceries.

The pause on interest charges during the 2020 suspension also could reduce the overall amount of student debt that borrowers will have to repay, especially if borrowers choose to continue making payments on their principal during the interest suspension.

Not all borrowers will benefit

Although the extension gives some borrowers more slack on their student debt in the short term, not all student loan borrowers benefit from the memo.

Borrowers pursuing federal loan forgiveness

Students who were on track with meeting the minimum repayment count requirements under the CARES Act may not have the same benefit after Sept. 30.

“This is an economic hardship deferment,” says Travis Hornsby, CFA and founder of Student Loan Planner, a student debt resource. “[Economic hardship deferment] doesn’t count toward PSLF and other forgiveness programs.”

This means that deferred payments for October, November and December won’t count toward the 120 payment requirement under Public Service Loan Forgiveness. For borrowers who want to qualify for student loan forgiveness, Hornsby says that “starting September 30, you might need to cancel your deferment to continue credit in the program.”

Borrowers with private student loans

Borrowers with private student loans miss out on federal protections, too. Although many private student loan lenders are offering temporary hardship relief options on an individual basis due to the effects of the pandemic, they aren’t obligated by law to offer these benefits.

“Private loans are the primary struggle for people right now, because federal loans have been suspended for a while,” says Hornsby.

If borrowers need their payments paused, Hornsby suggests contacting their servicer for a 90-day payment suspension. The type and duration of relief options is entirely up to the individual lender, and some private lenders may be more generous with deferment or forbearance than others.

If you’re having trouble keeping up with payments, another option worth exploring is refinancing your student loans. This may be particularly attractive if you’re currently locked into a high fixed interest rate; current student loan interest rates are at record lows, so refinancing could save you money if you’re unable to take advantage of private or federal relief options.

President Donald Trump’s executive order may have a big impact on your student loans.

Here’s what you need to know — what it means for your student loans.

Student Loans

In a memorandum to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Trump directed DeVos to extend several student loan benefits until December 31, 2020. The student loan relief follows similar student loan relief contained in the Cares Act (the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that Congress passed in March), which followed Trump’s executive action earlier this year that provided similar student loan relief for 60 days prior to passage of the Cares Act. “Currently, many Americans remain unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many more have accepted lower wages and reduced hours while States and localities continue to impose social distancing measures,” Trump wrote in the memorandum. “It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

Let’s dive in to understand what this means for your student loans.

Pause student loan payments

Under Trump’s executive action, your federal student loans will be paused through December 31, 2020. This means that you do not need to make payments until January 1, 2021. Absent this extension, your federal student loan payments would have resumed on October 1, 2020. Why? Congress passed the Cares Act, which provided multiple student loan benefits, including a student loan payment pause. If you want to pay off student loans faster, you can still pay your federal student loans during this period. Trump wrote in the memorandum that many student loan borrowers have continued to make student loan payments since March, despite the temporary pause, to pay off their student loans faster.

Interest will not accrue on your student loans

Until December 31, 2020, interest will not accrue on your federal student loans. Importantly, this does not change your interest rate. Rather, it means that during this period, no new interest will accrue on your federal student loan balance.

What about Public Service Loan Forgiveness?

Under the Cares Act, if you did not make payments while student loan payments were paused, any non-payment of federal student loan debt “counted” toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness. Similarly, the Cares Act also halted collection of federal student loan debt. Trump’s memorandum specifically references “continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education.” However, while it’s possible that these additional benefits also may continue, Trump’s memorandum does not specifically reference student loan debt collection or counting non-payments toward public service loan forgiveness, both of which were included as student loan relief in the Cares Act.

Is student loan forgiveness included?

In the wake of Covid-19, in particular, many student loan borrowers have asked whether their student loan debt will be cancelled. The answer is this: Trump’s executive order does not include student loan forgiveness. Like the Cares Act and the Heals Act, the $1 trillion stimulus package that Senate Republicans proposed, the executive order will not cancel your student loans. House Democrats proposed $10,000 of student loan forgiveness only for borrowers who are struggling financially, but the Senate has not passed the Heroes Act.

There have been multiple legislative and policy proposals to cancel student loans. For example, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed student loan forgiveness during her presidential campaign, and Student Debt Crisis, a student loan advocacy non-profit, recently sent Warren a petition signed by 1.2 million people to cancel student loan debt. Former Vice President Joe Biden proposed a Covid-19 student loan forgiveness plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower and forgive all undergraduate tuition from two- and four-year public colleges and universities.

Does this apply to all federal student loans?

No, the executive order only applies to federal student loans owned by the federal government. For example, this includes Direct Loans such as Stafford Loans. However, most FFELP Loans and Perkins loans are not owned by the federal government. Therefore, if you have one of these student loans not owned by the U.S. Department of Education, you would not benefit from these student loan benefits and must make student loan payments in the normal course. Similarly, if you have private student loans, payments would be due in the normal course. You can contact your student loan servicer if you are unsure what types of student loans that you have.

How to pay off student loans

What happens to my student loan balance? Remember this: even if your student loans are paused, you will still owe student loan payments when the executive order ends. This is important because your balance will not disappear as a result of this extension. Therefore, make sure you have a game plan to pay off student loans. What’s the best way to start? Start with these four options, all of which have no fees:

4,"Aug 10, 2020",Security Clearance News & Career Advice,Why the Government Doesn’t Care About Your Student Loan Debt,"It’s back to school time, with many college students headed back to campuses, even if they might not be headed into many classrooms. Whether the education is in person or virtual, however, it all comes with a bill, and college students today are graduating with an average debt of $29,000 – and many much, much more. If you have six-figure student loans, you may worry that your college debt will come up against your ability to obtain a government job or pursue a national security career. The reason is that finances are often cited as the top reason applicants are denied a security clearance – and debt does factor into that.

In an article last week Jillian Kramer outlined student loan concerns for security cleared professionals. Applicants shouldn’t be worried about their student loan debt – or any debt that they are consistently paying off. It’s not the amount of debt the government is concerned about for security clearance applicants, but the source of debt, and steps the clearance holder or applicant is taking to pay it off.

Financial considerations are notable for security clearance applicants because in the past, financial irresponsibility has pointed to other issues of reliability and trustworthiness. In the past, a number of famous spies were motivated by a desire to pay off debt they’d unwisely stacked up. With foreign adversaries attacking U.S. credit bureaus, and cross referencing that data with what was stolen in the OPM hack, financial considerations are something clearance holders can’t afford to overlook.

With student loans largely seen as an investment in the future – and your ability to work a national security career in the first place – you don’t need to worry that having some with negatively impact your clearance.","It’s back to school time, with many college students headed back to campuses, even if they might not be headed into many classrooms.

On Saturday, President Trump signed an executive memorandum that purports to extend student loan relief for millions of Americans. But the memorandum is vague, and it provides borrowers with little insight about borrowers’ rights, options, or obligations.

Trump issued the executive memorandum after Congress was unable to reach a compromise on extending student loan relief and other economic assistance programs that are expiring. Congress had suspended all payments, interest, and collections on government-held federal student loans for six months under the CARES Act. That student loan relief expires at the end of September. Democrats had supported a 12-month extension of the CARES Act’s student loan provisions, and an expansion of those provisions to cover other types of student loans, but Senate Republicans rejected this.

Key questions remain unanswered about the latest presidential memorandum, including how the order will impact borrowers in default, whether the extension of relief would be automatic, and whether borrowers on track for loan forgiveness programs will still get credit. The U.S. Department of Education has not responded to a request for comment, and the Department’s Student Aid Coronavirus website has not been updated.

Here’s what we know.

What Is The Timing of Trump’s Student Loan Order?

President Trump made public statements late last week suggesting that federal student payments and interest would be suspended “until further notice,” perhaps indefinitely. However, the memorandum only provides for a short three month extension, to December 31, 2020. So this is by no means a lengthy, open-ended, or indefinite suspension.

What Student Loans Are Covered By Trump’s Student Loan Order?

The memorandum does not specify what student loans are covered. However, the CARES Act only covered government-held federal student loans. Commercially-issued FFEL-program loans, Perkins loans, and private student loans were excluded from the CARES Act. The presidential memorandum is billed as an “extension” of existing protections, not an expansion, thus suggesting that no additional loans would be covered. This is further supported by the memorandum’s references to provisions of the Higher Education Act, which do not cover other types of student loans.

Will Borrowers Have To Do Anything To Qualify for the Student Loan Extension?

It is unclear whether the extension provided by the memorandum will be automatic. Under the CARES Act, interest and payments were automatically suspended for student loan borrowers, and no affirmative steps were required to obtain the relief. However, the Trump administration’s initial executive order in March suspending student loan payments required that borrowers contact their servicers to request the relief. The memorandum issued on Saturday simply states that the suspension should be continued “as necessary” — it is unclear if that puts the burden of determining that on the Department of Education, or on individual borrowers.

What About Student Loan Borrowers In Default?

It is not at all clear from the memorandum how this will impact borrowers who are in default on government-held federal student loans. Under the CARES Act, all involuntary collections against borrowers in default — such as wage garnishments and seizures of tax refunds — were temporarily halted. In addition, the months of suspended payments and interest would still qualify for loan rehabilitation programs, which allow borrowers to cure defaulted loans via temporary repayment plans. The memorandum does not reference defaulted borrowers at all, and so it is unclear if borrowers in default will have to resume payments or incur costly wage garnishments again after September 30.

Will The Extension Count Towards Loan Forgiveness?

Under the CARES Act, the months of suspended payments count towards loan forgiveness programs, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness, even if no payments are made, as long as the borrower otherwise qualifies and was on track prior to the CARES Act’s implementation. The memorandum, however, does not state whether or not that would continue to be the case during the extension between September 30th and December 31st. If those months do not count, or if the Education Department does not provide clear guidance, borrowers may be faced with a difficult decision to resume normal repayment to maintain progress towards loan forgiveness programs, or continue with suspended payments and risk having those months not be counted.

Lawmakers from both parties called the series of executive orders ""unconstitutional.""

Trump also signed a memorandum ordering Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to extend student loan relief policies included in the CARES Act that were scheduled to expire on September 30th, through the end of December.

The CARES Act, passed on March 27, paused federal student loan payments and temporarily set the federal student loan interest rate to 0%.

""It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.""

7,"Aug 10, 2020",MarketWatch,‘We’re essentially pushing the pain down the road’: Trump’s order to extend payment freeze on some student loans leaves ‘many unanswered questions’,"President Donald Trump extended the pause on payments and interest for some federal student loans as part of a slew of pandemic-related executive actions issued Saturday, but questions remain about how exactly the pause will be implemented and some borrower advocates say it doesn’t go far enough in providing meaningful relief.

As part of the CARES Act, the coronavirus relief package passed in March, Congress suspended payments and collections and waived interest on federal student loans held by the Department of Education. That pause was scheduled to expire on Sept. 30, about a month before the Presidential election.

In his memo to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, directing her to implement the executive action, Trump wrote that it is “appropriate” to extend the CARES Act policy “until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

The memo states that the payment pause and interest waiver on student loans held by the Department of Education will continue until Dec. 31, 2020.

Though it seems clear that student-loan borrowers who had their payments paused and interest waived through the CARES Act will be able to continue that pause through the end of the year, “we still have a lot of unanswered questions here,” said Ben Miller, vice president for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.

The Department of Education didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on its plans for implementing the executive action.

Outstanding questions

Those questions include, for example, whether the paused payments will count towards the 120 needed for borrowers to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program that allows public servants to have their federal student loans forgiven after 10 years of payments. During the payment pause period covered by the CARES Act, borrowers who are in a qualifying repayment plan are receiving credit as if they were making on time monthly payments.

In addition, it’s unclear whether borrowers who have defaulted on their student loans will have collections paused during the period covered by Trump’s executive action, said Kyra Taylor, a staff attorney focusing on student loans at the National Consumer Law Center. The CARES Act paused wage garnishment and other forms of involuntary collection for these borrowers. Nonetheless, some are still having their paychecks seized.

The mechanics of implementing the executive action are also still fuzzy, Miller said. Will borrowers opt in or opt out of this payment pause? How will student-loan servicers, the companies hired by the Department of Education to be borrowers’ point of contact during the repayment process, actually code this pause into their system?

At the outset of the CARES Act, these companies faced challenges implementing the payment pause and borrower advocates were already worried they’d struggle to deal with a crush of borrowers looking to change repayment plans as the pause lifted. For the past several weeks, these companies have been preparing to transition borrowers back into repayment.

“‘You’re just seeing that executive action is no replacement for real legislation by Congress in this situation’” — Ben Miller, vice president for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress

“As a practical matter it would clearly be so much better and so much easier for Congress to just extend what was in the CARES Act,” Miller said. “You’re just seeing that executive action is no replacement for real legislation by Congress in this situation.”

The Republican-led Senate proposed a coronavirus relief package last month that included a provision which would allow borrowers with no income to stay current on their loans without making payments, an option that is already available in the student-loan program. The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act in May, which extended the CARES Act payment pause until 2021 and provided $10,000 of student debt cancellation for some borrowers.

In addition to the confusion surrounding the President’s executive action, advocates have said it doesn’t go far enough to address the challenges student-loan borrowers are facing during this time. For one, like the CARES Act, it only covers federal student loans that are actually held by the Department of Education. That means at least $165 billion of federal student loans are ineligible for the payment pause, according to Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Savingforcollege.com.

Even for those borrowers that do qualify for the payment pause, “we’re essentially pushing the pain down the road,” said Julie Margetta Morgan, vice president of research at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank.

“What’s going to happen whenever these payments get restarted is that people’s debt burdens are going to be the same as they were at the beginning of the pandemic, but it’s more than likely that their capacity to repay is going to be substantially reduced,” she said.

“In order to provide people real, meaningful relief and to boost the economy, we have to look for some kind of debt cancellation,” she added.

Update: The U.S. Department of Education now says Trump’s suspension can count for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Read more here.

Over the weekend, President Trump extended the student loan repayment suspension for another three months. This is a big win for many student borrowers, but some won’t be so happy.

Borrowers hoping to get Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) won’t benefit from Trump’s executive order as much as other borrowers. The non-payments won’t count because of the way he defers student loan payments. The text of his order reads:

“Sec. 2. Extension of Student Loan Payment Relief. (a) In light of the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, the Secretary of Education shall take action pursuant to applicable law to effectuate appropriate waivers of and modifications to the requirements and conditions of economic hardship deferments described in section 455(f)(2)(D) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1087e(f)(2)(D), and provide such deferments to borrowers as necessary to continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education until December 31, 2020.”

The key words in that text are “economic hardship deferments.” These deferments are available to student borrowers today, but do not count towards the 120 payments required for borrowers to get loans discharged under PSLF.

When Congress suspended student loan payments in the CARES Act, many wondered if the suspension would count towards the number of payments required for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Luckily, Congress included language that said if borrower would have otherwise qualified, the non-payments would count towards forgiveness. So, if a borrower was still employed by a qualified employer, the months of non-payment counted towards PSLF.

But the CARES Act suspension expires on September 30, 2020. This will likely cause a great deal of confusion for many student borrowers. In the midst of a pandemic, many will think Trump’s executive order is an extension of the CARES Act, but it isn’t.

Any borrowers hoping to get PSLF should make their payments after September, otherwise they will be three more payments away from receiving loan forgiveness. They will have the added benefit of suspended interest and will be able to pay down the balance of their loan faster, though most PSLF borrowers aren’t concerned about that.

However, there is still time for Congress to take action and extend the CARES Act benefits. While the enhanced unemployment benefits from the CARES Act have already expired the student loan payment pause lasts through September. Negotiations have stalled, but as the pandemic continues to cost lives and hurt the economy, pressure to make a deal will likely escalate.

This story is developing.

President Donald Trump will suspend your federal student loan payments through December 31, 2020.

Here’s what you need to know.

Student Loans

Trump issued an executive order today that will grant additional student loan relief and provide a payroll tax cut, enhanced unemployment benefits and an eviction moratorium. Trump, who is seeking re-election, sent a memorandum today entitled “Continued Student Loan Payment Relief During the COVID-19 Pandemic” to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Trump ordered DeVos to extend several student loan benefits contained in the Cares Act until December 31, 2020. Congress passed the Cares Act, which is the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill that Congress, in March: Among other benefits, the Cares Act:

paused all payments for federal student loans; set interest rates at 0%, so interest will not accrue on your federal student loans; halted collection of federal student loan debt; and, among other benefits, “counted” non-payment of federal student loan debt toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness.

Trump’s memorandum specifically references “continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education.” However, Trump’s memorandum does not specifically reference student loan debt collection or counting non-payments toward public service loan forgiveness, both of which were included as student loan relief in the Cares Act. The student loan relief included in the Cares Act followed Trump’s executive action earlier this year that provided similar student loan relief for 60 days prior to passage of the Cares Act. Without today’s executive order, this student loan relief was slated to expire on September 30, 2020. Trump wrote that student loan borrowers can continue to make federal student loan payments in the normal course. Trump also noted in the memorandum that many student loan borrowers have continued to make student loan payments over the past five months, despite the temporary pause, to pay off their student loans faster.

“Currently, many Americans remain unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many more have accepted lower wages and reduced hours while States and localities continue to impose social distancing measures,” Trump wrote in the memorandum. “It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

Will I get student loan forgiveness?

Many student loan borrowers are wondering whether Trump’s executive order contains student loans forgiveness. Like the $1 trillion Heals Act that Senate Republicans proposed for the new stimulus package, Trump’s executive order does not include student loan forgiveness. While student loan forgiveness was not expected, borrowers have speculated what Trump’s executive order would mean for student loans during an unprecedented time of unemployment. House Democrats pushed for student loan forgiveness earlier this year in the Heroes Act, but the Republican-led Senate called the Heroes Act “dead on arrival.” Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed student loan forgiveness for 95% of Americans, and Student Debt Crisis, a student loan advocacy non-profit, recently sent Warren a petition signed by 1.2 million people to cancel student loan debt. Among other student loan relief, former Vice President Joe Biden proposed a Covid-19 student loan forgiveness plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower and forgive all undergraduate tuition from two- and four-year public colleges and universities.

How to pay off student loans

Even if your student loans are paused, you will still owe student loan payments when the executive order ends. Plus, private student loans are not paused and are still due. FFELP Loans and Perkins loans not owned by the federal government are also not included. Therefore, make sure you have a game plan to pay off student loans. What’s the best way to start? Start with these four options, all of which have no fees:

In a historic decision, Joe Biden has selected Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) as his running mate. Harris will be the first Black female Vice Presidential candidate on a major party ticket.

Student loans continue to be a major national issue, and the 2020 election may determine the future of existing student loan forgiveness programs, as well as broader debt cancellation proposals that have rapidly gained momentum in recent months. There is also speculation that Biden, if elected, may only serve one term, which means that Harris could have a shot at the presidency in just four years.

So where does Kamala Harris stand? Her positions has evolved over time, but she has voiced support for broad student loan forgiveness.

Kamala Harris: Past Student Loan Positions

When she served as California's Attorney General, Harris established herself as an early leader in the struggle to stop predatory for-profit schools from defrauding students. Her office sued one of the largest for-profit college chains in the nation — Corinthian Colleges — and she played a key role in bringing down the company, which allegedly saddled thousands of student loan borrowers with mountains of debt and limited career prospects. Harris has since been a strong proponent of Borrower Defense to Repayment, a program established to provide relief to student loan borrowers defrauded by their schools.

Harris has also supported initiatives for free college. She backed the College For All Act in 2017 (a bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders), and she co-sponsored the Debt-Free College Act of 2018, which would have created a federal-state partnership to incentivize states to reduce or eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities.

As a presidential candidate, Harris came out with her own student loan forgiveness plan. She proposed cancelling up to $20,000 in student loans for borrowers who established successful new businesses in underserved communities. However, the plan was criticized by some as being narrowly focused and unwieldy.

Kamala Harris: More Recent Positions on Student Loans

As recently as two weeks ago, Harris made public statements in support of broad student loan forgiveness. Publicly touting Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan, which supports investment in communities to achieve economic and racial justice, Harris voiced support for $10,000 in across-the-board student loan forgiveness for borrowers as a form of economic stimulus in response to the Coronavirus pandemic and the associated recession — a plan that is broadly supported by other Democratic senators.

Harris has also continued to reiterate support for the Borrower Defense to Repayment program, voting in favor of reversing new rules put in place by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that imposed new barriers for borrowers seeking relief. President Trump subsequently vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have restored the original Obama-era Borrower Defense rules.

Harris is a co-sponsor of the What You Can Do For Your Country Act, a bill that would substantially overhaul improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The bill would allow payments made under any repayment plan on both Direct and FFEL loans — not just income-driven plans or just Direct loans — to qualify for PSLF. And it would allow borrowers to get 50% of their loan balance forgiven after five years of public service work, with the remainder forgiven after the second five year period.

Harris has also called on the Senate to pass the HEROES Act, the $3.4 trillion stimulus bill passed by House Democrats in April. That bill would provide $10,000 in federal and private student loan forgiveness to economically distressed borrowers, and would extend the existing freeze on student loan payments and interest for a full 12 months. Senate Republicans have opposed that measure.

On Aug. 8, 2020, President Trump issued four administrative actions — one executive order and three memorandums — in response to the ongoing hardships that Americans are facing during the coronavirus pandemic. One of the three memos extends student loan payment deferment through the end of 2020.

This latest student loan payment relief memorandum, however, is not entirely the same as the aid under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Here’s what you need to know.

Key takeaways: What we know so far about the executive orders

Payments for federal student loans are deferred through Dec. 31, 2020.

Federal borrowers won’t have to pay interest during the extended deferment period.

Private student loan borrowers still won’t receive federal protections.

Payments that are deferred during this period likely won’t count toward loan forgiveness.

Federal loan payments are expected to restart on Jan. 1, 2021.

The memo is not an extension of the CARES Act

Some details of the memorandum include similar actions from the CARES Act, but there are also key differences.

The CARES Act, which was signed into law March 27, 2020, automatically suspends federal student loan payments through Sept. 30, 2020. It also states that, during this period, interest rate charges are set to 0 percent APR and won’t accrue on student loans owned by the U.S. Department of Education.

Borrowers who are pursuing federal loan forgiveness programs still receive credit during the suspension period under the CARES Act. To have paused payments credited toward their forgiveness payment count, borrowers must continue to meet other qualification requirements.

The latest memo issued by President Trump provides extended loan payment relief for federally owned student loans through Dec. 31, 2020, and waives interest charges during this time. However, there’s currently no language in the memorandum addressing whether borrowers working toward student loan forgiveness will still receive credit.

Whether the president has the legal authority to suspend interest on student loans without Congressional approval is still unclear.

How the president’s executive orders help federal student loan borrowers

The original federal student loan protections through the CARES Act are set to end on Sept. 30, so this extension gives borrowers with government-owned loans an extra three months of relief from making payments.

The U.S. unemployment rate is currently at 10.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Borrowers who’ve lost their jobs or experienced a reduction in pay due to COVID-19 can redirect funds that would’ve been used for federal student loan payments toward other essential needs, like housing and groceries.

The pause on interest charges during the 2020 suspension also could reduce the overall amount of student debt that borrowers will have to repay, especially if borrowers choose to continue making payments on their principal during the interest suspension.

Not all borrowers will benefit

Although the extension gives some borrowers more slack on their student debt in the short term, not all student loan borrowers benefit from the memo.

Borrowers pursuing federal loan forgiveness

Students who were on track with meeting the minimum repayment count requirements under the CARES Act may not have the same benefit after Sept. 30.

“This is an economic hardship deferment,” says Travis Hornsby, CFA and founder of Student Loan Planner, a student debt resource. “[Economic hardship deferment] doesn’t count toward PSLF and other forgiveness programs.”

This means that deferred payments for October, November and December won’t count toward the 120 payment requirement under Public Service Loan Forgiveness. For borrowers who want to qualify for student loan forgiveness, Hornsby says that “starting September 30, you might need to cancel your deferment to continue credit in the program.”

Borrowers with private student loans

Borrowers with private student loans miss out on federal protections, too. Although many private student loan lenders are offering temporary hardship relief options on an individual basis due to the effects of the pandemic, they aren’t obligated by law to offer these benefits.

“Private loans are the primary struggle for people right now, because federal loans have been suspended for a while,” says Hornsby.

If borrowers need their payments paused, Hornsby suggests contacting their servicer for a 90-day payment suspension. The type and duration of relief options is entirely up to the individual lender, and some private lenders may be more generous with deferment or forbearance than others.

If you’re having trouble keeping up with payments, another option worth exploring is refinancing your student loans. This may be particularly attractive if you’re currently locked into a high fixed interest rate; current student loan interest rates are at record lows, so refinancing could save you money if you’re unable to take advantage of private or federal relief options.

President Donald Trump’s executive order may have a big impact on your student loans.

Here’s what you need to know — what it means for your student loans.

Student Loans

In a memorandum to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Trump directed DeVos to extend several student loan benefits until December 31, 2020. The student loan relief follows similar student loan relief contained in the Cares Act (the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that Congress passed in March), which followed Trump’s executive action earlier this year that provided similar student loan relief for 60 days prior to passage of the Cares Act. “Currently, many Americans remain unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many more have accepted lower wages and reduced hours while States and localities continue to impose social distancing measures,” Trump wrote in the memorandum. “It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

Let’s dive in to understand what this means for your student loans.

Pause student loan payments

Under Trump’s executive action, your federal student loans will be paused through December 31, 2020. This means that you do not need to make payments until January 1, 2021. Absent this extension, your federal student loan payments would have resumed on October 1, 2020. Why? Congress passed the Cares Act, which provided multiple student loan benefits, including a student loan payment pause. If you want to pay off student loans faster, you can still pay your federal student loans during this period. Trump wrote in the memorandum that many student loan borrowers have continued to make student loan payments since March, despite the temporary pause, to pay off their student loans faster.

Interest will not accrue on your student loans

Until December 31, 2020, interest will not accrue on your federal student loans. Importantly, this does not change your interest rate. Rather, it means that during this period, no new interest will accrue on your federal student loan balance.

What about Public Service Loan Forgiveness?

Under the Cares Act, if you did not make payments while student loan payments were paused, any non-payment of federal student loan debt “counted” toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness. Similarly, the Cares Act also halted collection of federal student loan debt. Trump’s memorandum specifically references “continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education.” However, while it’s possible that these additional benefits also may continue, Trump’s memorandum does not specifically reference student loan debt collection or counting non-payments toward public service loan forgiveness, both of which were included as student loan relief in the Cares Act.

Is student loan forgiveness included?

In the wake of Covid-19, in particular, many student loan borrowers have asked whether their student loan debt will be cancelled. The answer is this: Trump’s executive order does not include student loan forgiveness. Like the Cares Act and the Heals Act, the $1 trillion stimulus package that Senate Republicans proposed, the executive order will not cancel your student loans. House Democrats proposed $10,000 of student loan forgiveness only for borrowers who are struggling financially, but the Senate has not passed the Heroes Act.

There have been multiple legislative and policy proposals to cancel student loans. For example, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed student loan forgiveness during her presidential campaign, and Student Debt Crisis, a student loan advocacy non-profit, recently sent Warren a petition signed by 1.2 million people to cancel student loan debt. Former Vice President Joe Biden proposed a Covid-19 student loan forgiveness plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower and forgive all undergraduate tuition from two- and four-year public colleges and universities.

Does this apply to all federal student loans?

No, the executive order only applies to federal student loans owned by the federal government. For example, this includes Direct Loans such as Stafford Loans. However, most FFELP Loans and Perkins loans are not owned by the federal government. Therefore, if you have one of these student loans not owned by the U.S. Department of Education, you would not benefit from these student loan benefits and must make student loan payments in the normal course. Similarly, if you have private student loans, payments would be due in the normal course. You can contact your student loan servicer if you are unsure what types of student loans that you have.

How to pay off student loans

What happens to my student loan balance? Remember this: even if your student loans are paused, you will still owe student loan payments when the executive order ends. This is important because your balance will not disappear as a result of this extension. Therefore, make sure you have a game plan to pay off student loans. What’s the best way to start? Start with these four options, all of which have no fees:

14,"Aug 10, 2020",Security Clearance News & Career Advice,Why the Government Doesn’t Care About Your Student Loan Debt,"It’s back to school time, with many college students headed back to campuses, even if they might not be headed into many classrooms. Whether the education is in person or virtual, however, it all comes with a bill, and college students today are graduating with an average debt of $29,000 – and many much, much more. If you have six-figure student loans, you may worry that your college debt will come up against your ability to obtain a government job or pursue a national security career. The reason is that finances are often cited as the top reason applicants are denied a security clearance – and debt does factor into that.

In an article last week Jillian Kramer outlined student loan concerns for security cleared professionals.

On Saturday, President Trump signed an executive memorandum that purports to extend student loan relief for millions of Americans. But the memorandum is vague, and it provides borrowers with little insight about borrowers’ rights, options, or obligations.

Trump issued the executive memorandum after Congress was unable to reach a compromise on extending student loan relief and other economic assistance programs that are expiring. Congress had suspended all payments, interest, and collections on government-held federal student loans for six months under the CARES Act. That student loan relief expires at the end of September. Democrats had supported a 12-month extension of the CARES Act’s student loan provisions, and an expansion of those provisions to cover other types of student loans, but Senate Republicans rejected this.

Key questions remain unanswered about the latest presidential memorandum, including how the order will impact borrowers in default, whether the extension of relief would be automatic, and whether borrowers on track for loan forgiveness programs will still get credit. The U.S. Department of Education has not responded to a request for comment, and the Department’s Student Aid Coronavirus website has not been updated.

Here’s what we know.

What Is The Timing of Trump’s Student Loan Order?

President Trump made public statements late last week suggesting that federal student payments and interest would be suspended “until further notice,” perhaps indefinitely. However, the memorandum only provides for a short three month extension, to December 31, 2020. So this is by no means a lengthy, open-ended, or indefinite suspension.

What Student Loans Are Covered By Trump’s Student Loan Order?

The memorandum does not specify what student loans are covered. However, the CARES Act only covered government-held federal student loans. Commercially-issued FFEL-program loans, Perkins loans, and private student loans were excluded from the CARES Act. The presidential memorandum is billed as an “extension” of existing protections, not an expansion, thus suggesting that no additional loans would be covered. This is further supported by the memorandum’s references to provisions of the Higher Education Act, which do not cover other types of student loans.

Will Borrowers Have To Do Anything To Qualify for the Student Loan Extension?

It is unclear whether the extension provided by the memorandum will be automatic. Under the CARES Act, interest and payments were automatically suspended for student loan borrowers, and no affirmative steps were required to obtain the relief. However, the Trump administration’s initial executive order in March suspending student loan payments required that borrowers contact their servicers to request the relief. The memorandum issued on Saturday simply states that the suspension should be continued “as necessary” — it is unclear if that puts the burden of determining that on the Department of Education, or on individual borrowers.

What About Student Loan Borrowers In Default?

It is not at all clear from the memorandum how this will impact borrowers who are in default on government-held federal student loans. Under the CARES Act, all involuntary collections against borrowers in default — such as wage garnishments and seizures of tax refunds — were temporarily halted. In addition, the months of suspended payments and interest would still qualify for loan rehabilitation programs, which allow borrowers to cure defaulted loans via temporary repayment plans. The memorandum does not reference defaulted borrowers at all, and so it is unclear if borrowers in default will have to resume payments or incur costly wage garnishments again after September 30.

Will The Extension Count Towards Loan Forgiveness?

Under the CARES Act, the months of suspended payments count towards loan forgiveness programs, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness, even if no payments are made, as long as the borrower otherwise qualifies and was on track prior to the CARES Act’s implementation. The memorandum, however, does not state whether or not that would continue to be the case during the extension between September 30th and December 31st. If those months do not count, or if the Education Department does not provide clear guidance, borrowers may be faced with a difficult decision to resume normal repayment to maintain progress towards loan forgiveness programs, or continue with suspended payments and risk having those months not be counted.

16,"Aug 10, 2020",CNBC,Here's how Trump's weekend executive actions will impact student loans,"On Saturday, President Donald Trump signed several executive actions aimed at addressing the financial impacts the coronavirus pandemic has had on the U.S. economy after Congress failed to pass a new stimulus package. Lawmakers from both parties called the series of executive orders ""unconstitutional.""

Trump also signed a memorandum ordering Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to extend student loan relief policies included in the CARES Act that were scheduled to expire on September 30th, through the end of December.

The CARES Act, passed on March 27, paused federal student loan payments and temporarily set the federal student loan interest rate to 0%.

17,"Aug 10, 2020",MarketWatch,‘We’re essentially pushing the pain down the road’: Trump’s order to extend payment freeze on some student loans leaves ‘many unanswered questions’,"President Donald Trump extended the pause on payments and interest for some federal student loans as part of a slew of pandemic-related executive actions issued Saturday, but questions remain about how exactly the pause will be implemented and some borrower advocates say it doesn’t go far enough in providing meaningful relief.

As part of the CARES Act, the coronavirus relief package passed in March, Congress suspended payments and collections and waived interest on federal student loans held by the Department of Education. That pause was scheduled to expire on Sept. 30, about a month before the Presidential election.

In his memo to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, directing her to implement the executive action, Trump wrote that it is “appropriate” to extend the CARES Act policy “until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

The memo states that the payment pause and interest waiver on student loans held by the Department of Education will continue until Dec. 31, 2020.

Though it seems clear that student-loan borrowers who had their payments paused and interest waived through the CARES Act will be able to continue that pause through the end of the year, “we still have a lot of unanswered questions here,” said Ben Miller, vice president for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.

The Department of Education didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on its plans for implementing the executive action.

Outstanding questions

Those questions include, for example, whether the paused payments will count towards the 120 needed for borrowers to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program that allows public servants to have their federal student loans forgiven after 10 years of payments. During the payment pause period covered by the CARES Act, borrowers who are in a qualifying repayment plan are receiving credit as if they were making on time monthly payments.

In addition, it’s unclear whether borrowers who have defaulted on their student loans will have collections paused during the period covered by Trump’s executive action, said Kyra Taylor, a staff attorney focusing on student loans at the National Consumer Law Center. The CARES Act paused wage garnishment and other forms of involuntary collection for these borrowers. Nonetheless, some are still having their paychecks seized.

The mechanics of implementing the executive action are also still fuzzy, Miller said. Will borrowers opt in or opt out of this payment pause? How will student-loan servicers, the companies hired by the Department of Education to be borrowers’ point of contact during the repayment process, actually code this pause into their system?

At the outset of the CARES Act, these companies faced challenges implementing the payment pause and borrower advocates were already worried they’d struggle to deal with a crush of borrowers looking to change repayment plans as the pause lifted. For the past several weeks, these companies have been preparing to transition borrowers back into repayment.

“‘You’re just seeing that executive action is no replacement for real legislation by Congress in this situation’” — Ben Miller, vice president for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress

“As a practical matter it would clearly be so much better and so much easier for Congress to just extend what was in the CARES Act,” Miller said. “You’re just seeing that executive action is no replacement for real legislation by Congress in this situation.”

The Republican-led Senate proposed a coronavirus relief package last month that included a provision which would allow borrowers with no income to stay current on their loans without making payments, an option that is already available in the student-loan program. The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act in May, which extended the CARES Act payment pause until 2021 and provided $10,000 of student debt cancellation for some borrowers.

In addition to the confusion surrounding the President’s executive action, advocates have said it doesn’t go far enough to address the challenges student-loan borrowers are facing during this time. For one, like the CARES Act, it only covers federal student loans that are actually held by the Department of Education. That means at least $165 billion of federal student loans are ineligible for the payment pause, according to Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Savingforcollege.com.

Even for those borrowers that do qualify for the payment pause, “we’re essentially pushing the pain down the road,” said Julie Margetta Morgan, vice president of research at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank.

“What’s going to happen whenever these payments get restarted is that people’s debt burdens are going to be the same as they were at the beginning of the pandemic, but it’s more than likely that their capacity to repay is going to be substantially reduced,” she said.

“In order to provide people real, meaningful relief and to boost the economy, we have to look for some kind of debt cancellation,” she added.

Update: The U.S. Department of Education now says Trump’s suspension can count for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Read more here.

Over the weekend, President Trump extended the student loan repayment suspension for another three months. This is a big win for many student borrowers, but some won’t be so happy.

Borrowers hoping to get Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) won’t benefit from Trump’s executive order as much as other borrowers. The non-payments won’t count because of the way he defers student loan payments. The text of his order reads:

“Sec. 2. Extension of Student Loan Payment Relief. (a) In light of the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, the Secretary of Education shall take action pursuant to applicable law to effectuate appropriate waivers of and modifications to the requirements and conditions of economic hardship deferments described in section 455(f)(2)(D) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1087e(f)(2)(D), and provide such deferments to borrowers as necessary to continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education until December 31, 2020.”

The key words in that text are “economic hardship deferments.” These deferments are available to student borrowers today, but do not count towards the 120 payments required for borrowers to get loans discharged under PSLF.

When Congress suspended student loan payments in the CARES Act, many wondered if the suspension would count towards the number of payments required for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Luckily, Congress included language that said if borrower would have otherwise qualified, the non-payments would count towards forgiveness. So, if a borrower was still employed by a qualified employer, the months of non-payment counted towards PSLF.

But the CARES Act suspension expires on September 30, 2020. This will likely cause a great deal of confusion for many student borrowers. In the midst of a pandemic, many will think Trump’s executive order is an extension of the CARES Act, but it isn’t.

Any borrowers hoping to get PSLF should make their payments after September, otherwise they will be three more payments away from receiving loan forgiveness. They will have the added benefit of suspended interest and will be able to pay down the balance of their loan faster, though most PSLF borrowers aren’t concerned about that.

However, there is still time for Congress to take action and extend the CARES Act benefits. While the enhanced unemployment benefits from the CARES Act have already expired the student loan payment pause lasts through September. Negotiations have stalled, but as the pandemic continues to cost lives and hurt the economy, pressure to make a deal will likely escalate.

This story is developing.

President Donald Trump will suspend your federal student loan payments through December 31, 2020.

Here’s what you need to know.

Student Loans

Trump issued an executive order today that will grant additional student loan relief and provide a payroll tax cut, enhanced unemployment benefits and an eviction moratorium. Trump, who is seeking re-election, sent a memorandum today entitled “Continued Student Loan Payment Relief During the COVID-19 Pandemic” to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Trump ordered DeVos to extend several student loan benefits contained in the Cares Act until December 31, 2020. Congress passed the Cares Act, which is the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill that Congress, in March: Among other benefits, the Cares Act:

paused all payments for federal student loans; set interest rates at 0%, so interest will not accrue on your federal student loans; halted collection of federal student loan debt; and, among other benefits, “counted” non-payment of federal student loan debt toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness.

Trump’s memorandum specifically references “continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education.” However, Trump’s memorandum does not specifically reference student loan debt collection or counting non-payments toward public service loan forgiveness, both of which were included as student loan relief in the Cares Act. The student loan relief included in the Cares Act followed Trump’s executive action earlier this year that provided similar student loan relief for 60 days prior to passage of the Cares Act. Without today’s executive order, this student loan relief was slated to expire on September 30, 2020. Trump wrote that student loan borrowers can continue to make federal student loan payments in the normal course. Trump also noted in the memorandum that many student loan borrowers have continued to make student loan payments over the past five months, despite the temporary pause, to pay off their student loans faster.

“Currently, many Americans remain unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many more have accepted lower wages and reduced hours while States and localities continue to impose social distancing measures,” Trump wrote in the memorandum. “It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

Will I get student loan forgiveness?

Many student loan borrowers are wondering whether Trump’s executive order contains student loans forgiveness. Like the $1 trillion Heals Act that Senate Republicans proposed for the new stimulus package, Trump’s executive order does not include student loan forgiveness. While student loan forgiveness was not expected, borrowers have speculated what Trump’s executive order would mean for student loans during an unprecedented time of unemployment. House Democrats pushed for student loan forgiveness earlier this year in the Heroes Act, but the Republican-led Senate called the Heroes Act “dead on arrival.” Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed student loan forgiveness for 95% of Americans, and Student Debt Crisis, a student loan advocacy non-profit, recently sent Warren a petition signed by 1.2 million people to cancel student loan debt. Among other student loan relief, former Vice President Joe Biden proposed a Covid-19 student loan forgiveness plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower and forgive all undergraduate tuition from two- and four-year public colleges and universities.

How to pay off student loans

Even if your student loans are paused, you will still owe student loan payments when the executive order ends. Plus, private student loans are not paused and are still due. FFELP Loans and Perkins loans not owned by the federal government are also not included. Therefore, make sure you have a game plan to pay off student loans. What’s the best way to start?

In a historic decision, Joe Biden has selected Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) as his running mate. Harris will be the first Black female Vice Presidential candidate on a major party ticket.

Student loans continue to be a major national issue, and the 2020 election may determine the future of existing student loan forgiveness programs, as well as broader debt cancellation proposals that have rapidly gained momentum in recent months. There is also speculation that Biden, if elected, may only serve one term, which means that Harris could have a shot at the presidency in just four years.

So where does Kamala Harris stand? Her positions has evolved over time, but she has voiced support for broad student loan forgiveness.

Kamala Harris: Past Student Loan Positions

When she served as California's Attorney General, Harris established herself as an early leader in the struggle to stop predatory for-profit schools from defrauding students. Her office sued one of the largest for-profit college chains in the nation — Corinthian Colleges — and she played a key role in bringing down the company, which allegedly saddled thousands of student loan borrowers with mountains of debt and limited career prospects. Harris has since been a strong proponent of Borrower Defense to Repayment, a program established to provide relief to student loan borrowers defrauded by their schools.

Harris has also supported initiatives for free college. She backed the College For All Act in 2017 (a bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders), and she co-sponsored the Debt-Free College Act of 2018, which would have created a federal-state partnership to incentivize states to reduce or eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities.

As a presidential candidate, Harris came out with her own student loan forgiveness plan. She proposed cancelling up to $20,000 in student loans for borrowers who established successful new businesses in underserved communities. However, the plan was criticized by some as being narrowly focused and unwieldy.

Kamala Harris: More Recent Positions on Student Loans

As recently as two weeks ago, Harris made public statements in support of broad student loan forgiveness. Publicly touting Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan, which supports investment in communities to achieve economic and racial justice, Harris voiced support for $10,000 in across-the-board student loan forgiveness for borrowers as a form of economic stimulus in response to the Coronavirus pandemic and the associated recession — a plan that is broadly supported by other Democratic senators.

Harris has also continued to reiterate support for the Borrower Defense to Repayment program, voting in favor of reversing new rules put in place by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that imposed new barriers for borrowers seeking relief. President Trump subsequently vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have restored the original Obama-era Borrower Defense rules.

Harris is a co-sponsor of the What You Can Do For Your Country Act, a bill that would substantially overhaul improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The bill would allow payments made under any repayment plan on both Direct and FFEL loans — not just income-driven plans or just Direct loans — to qualify for PSLF. And it would allow borrowers to get 50% of their loan balance forgiven after five years of public service work, with the remainder forgiven after the second five year period.

Harris has also called on the Senate to pass the HEROES Act, the $3.4 trillion stimulus bill passed by House Democrats in April. That bill would provide $10,000 in federal and private student loan forgiveness to economically distressed borrowers, and would extend the existing freeze on student loan payments and interest for a full 12 months. Senate Republicans have opposed that measure.

On Aug. 8, 2020, President Trump issued four administrative actions — one executive order and three memorandums — in response to the ongoing hardships that Americans are facing during the coronavirus pandemic. One of the three memos extends student loan payment deferment through the end of 2020.

This latest student loan payment relief memorandum, however, is not entirely the same as the aid under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Here’s what you need to know.

Key takeaways: What we know so far about the executive orders

Payments for federal student loans are deferred through Dec. 31, 2020.

Federal borrowers won’t have to pay interest during the extended deferment period.

Private student loan borrowers still won’t receive federal protections.

Payments that are deferred during this period likely won’t count toward loan forgiveness.

Federal loan payments are expected to restart on Jan. 1, 2021.

The memo is not an extension of the CARES Act

Some details of the memorandum include similar actions from the CARES Act, but there are also key differences.

The CARES Act, which was signed into law March 27, 2020, automatically suspends federal student loan payments through Sept. 30, 2020. It also states that, during this period, interest rate charges are set to 0 percent APR and won’t accrue on student loans owned by the U.S. Department of Education.

Borrowers who are pursuing federal loan forgiveness programs still receive credit during the suspension period under the CARES Act. To have paused payments credited toward their forgiveness payment count, borrowers must continue to meet other qualification requirements.

The latest memo issued by President Trump provides extended loan payment relief for federally owned student loans through Dec. 31, 2020, and waives interest charges during this time. However, there’s currently no language in the memorandum addressing whether borrowers working toward student loan forgiveness will still receive credit.

Whether the president has the legal authority to suspend interest on student loans without Congressional approval is still unclear.

How the president’s executive orders help federal student loan borrowers

The original federal student loan protections through the CARES Act are set to end on Sept. 30, so this extension gives borrowers with government-owned loans an extra three months of relief from making payments.

The U.S. unemployment rate is currently at 10.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Borrowers who’ve lost their jobs or experienced a reduction in pay due to COVID-19 can redirect funds that would’ve been used for federal student loan payments toward other essential needs, like housing and groceries.

The pause on interest charges during the 2020 suspension also could reduce the overall amount of student debt that borrowers will have to repay, especially if borrowers choose to continue making payments on their principal during the interest suspension.

Not all borrowers will benefit

Although the extension gives some borrowers more slack on their student debt in the short term, not all student loan borrowers benefit from the memo.

Borrowers pursuing federal loan forgiveness

Students who were on track with meeting the minimum repayment count requirements under the CARES Act may not have the same benefit after Sept. 30.

“This is an economic hardship deferment,” says Travis Hornsby, CFA and founder of Student Loan Planner, a student debt resource. “[Economic hardship deferment] doesn’t count toward PSLF and other forgiveness programs.”

This means that deferred payments for October, November and December won’t count toward the 120 payment requirement under Public Service Loan Forgiveness. For borrowers who want to qualify for student loan forgiveness, Hornsby says that “starting September 30, you might need to cancel your deferment to continue credit in the program.”

Borrowers with private student loans

Borrowers with private student loans miss out on federal protections, too. Although many private student loan lenders are offering temporary hardship relief options on an individual basis due to the effects of the pandemic, they aren’t obligated by law to offer these benefits.

“Private loans are the primary struggle for people right now, because federal loans have been suspended for a while,” says Hornsby.

If borrowers need their payments paused, Hornsby suggests contacting their servicer for a 90-day payment suspension. The type and duration of relief options is entirely up to the individual lender, and some private lenders may be more generous with deferment or forbearance than others.

If you’re having trouble keeping up with payments, another option worth exploring is refinancing your student loans. This may be particularly attractive if you’re currently locked into a high fixed interest rate; current student loan interest rates are at record lows, so refinancing could save you money if you’re unable to take advantage of private or federal relief options.

President Donald Trump’s executive order may have a big impact on your student loans.

Here’s what you need to know — what it means for your student loans.

Student Loans

In a memorandum to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Trump directed DeVos to extend several student loan benefits until December 31, 2020. The student loan relief follows similar student loan relief contained in the Cares Act (the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that Congress passed in March), which followed Trump’s executive action earlier this year that provided similar student loan relief for 60 days prior to passage of the Cares Act. “Currently, many Americans remain unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many more have accepted lower wages and reduced hours while States and localities continue to impose social distancing measures,” Trump wrote in the memorandum. “It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

Let’s dive in to understand what this means for your student loans.

Pause student loan payments

Under Trump’s executive action, your federal student loans will be paused through December 31, 2020. This means that you do not need to make payments until January 1, 2021. Absent this extension, your federal student loan payments would have resumed on October 1, 2020. Why? Congress passed the Cares Act, which provided multiple student loan benefits, including a student loan payment pause. If you want to pay off student loans faster, you can still pay your federal student loans during this period. Trump wrote in the memorandum that many student loan borrowers have continued to make student loan payments since March, despite the temporary pause, to pay off their student loans faster.

Interest will not accrue on your student loans

Until December 31, 2020, interest will not accrue on your federal student loans. Importantly, this does not change your interest rate. Rather, it means that during this period, no new interest will accrue on your federal student loan balance.

What about Public Service Loan Forgiveness?

Under the Cares Act, if you did not make payments while student loan payments were paused, any non-payment of federal student loan debt “counted” toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness. Similarly, the Cares Act also halted collection of federal student loan debt. Trump’s memorandum specifically references “continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education.” However, while it’s possible that these additional benefits also may continue, Trump’s memorandum does not specifically reference student loan debt collection or counting non-payments toward public service loan forgiveness, both of which were included as student loan relief in the Cares Act.

Is student loan forgiveness included?

In the wake of Covid-19, in particular, many student loan borrowers have asked whether their student loan debt will be cancelled. The answer is this: Trump’s executive order does not include student loan forgiveness. Like the Cares Act and the Heals Act, the $1 trillion stimulus package that Senate Republicans proposed, the executive order will not cancel your student loans. House Democrats proposed $10,000 of student loan forgiveness only for borrowers who are struggling financially, but the Senate has not passed the Heroes Act.

There have been multiple legislative and policy proposals to cancel student loans. For example, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed student loan forgiveness during her presidential campaign, and Student Debt Crisis, a student loan advocacy non-profit, recently sent Warren a petition signed by 1.2 million people to cancel student loan debt. Former Vice President Joe Biden proposed a Covid-19 student loan forgiveness plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower and forgive all undergraduate tuition from two- and four-year public colleges and universities.

Does this apply to all federal student loans?

No, the executive order only applies to federal student loans owned by the federal government. For example, this includes Direct Loans such as Stafford Loans. However, most FFELP Loans and Perkins loans are not owned by the federal government. Therefore, if you have one of these student loans not owned by the U.S. Department of Education, you would not benefit from these student loan benefits and must make student loan payments in the normal course. Similarly, if you have private student loans, payments would be due in the normal course. You can contact your student loan servicer if you are unsure what types of student loans that you have.

How to pay off student loans

What happens to my student loan balance? Remember this: even if your student loans are paused, you will still owe student loan payments when the executive order ends. This is important because your balance will not disappear as a result of this extension. Therefore, make sure you have a game plan to pay off student loans. What’s the best way to start? Start with these four options, all of which have no fees:

On Saturday, President Trump signed an executive memorandum that purports to extend student loan relief for millions of Americans. But the memorandum is vague, and it provides borrowers with little insight about borrowers’ rights, options, or obligations.

Trump issued the executive memorandum after Congress was unable to reach a compromise on extending student loan relief and other economic assistance programs that are expiring. Congress had suspended all payments, interest, and collections on government-held federal student loans for six months under the CARES Act. That student loan relief expires at the end of September. Democrats had supported a 12-month extension of the CARES Act’s student loan provisions, and an expansion of those provisions to cover other types of student loans, but Senate Republicans rejected this.

Key questions remain unanswered about the latest presidential memorandum, including how the order will impact borrowers in default, whether the extension of relief would be automatic, and whether borrowers on track for loan forgiveness programs will still get credit. The U.S. Department of Education has not responded to a request for comment, and the Department’s Student Aid Coronavirus website has not been updated.

Here’s what we know.

What Is The Timing of Trump’s Student Loan Order?

President Trump made public statements late last week suggesting that federal student payments and interest would be suspended “until further notice,” perhaps indefinitely. However, the memorandum only provides for a short three month extension, to December 31, 2020. So this is by no means a lengthy, open-ended, or indefinite suspension.

What Student Loans Are Covered By Trump’s Student Loan Order?

The memorandum does not specify what student loans are covered. However, the CARES Act only covered government-held federal student loans. Commercially-issued FFEL-program loans, Perkins loans, and private student loans were excluded from the CARES Act. The presidential memorandum is billed as an “extension” of existing protections, not an expansion, thus suggesting that no additional loans would be covered. This is further supported by the memorandum’s references to provisions of the Higher Education Act, which do not cover other types of student loans.

Will Borrowers Have To Do Anything To Qualify for the Student Loan Extension?

It is unclear whether the extension provided by the memorandum will be automatic. Under the CARES Act, interest and payments were automatically suspended for student loan borrowers, and no affirmative steps were required to obtain the relief. However, the Trump administration’s initial executive order in March suspending student loan payments required that borrowers contact their servicers to request the relief. The memorandum issued on Saturday simply states that the suspension should be continued “as necessary” — it is unclear if that puts the burden of determining that on the Department of Education, or on individual borrowers.

What About Student Loan Borrowers In Default?

It is not at all clear from the memorandum how this will impact borrowers who are in default on government-held federal student loans. Under the CARES Act, all involuntary collections against borrowers in default — such as wage garnishments and seizures of tax refunds — were temporarily halted. In addition, the months of suspended payments and interest would still qualify for loan rehabilitation programs, which allow borrowers to cure defaulted loans via temporary repayment plans. The memorandum does not reference defaulted borrowers at all, and so it is unclear if borrowers in default will have to resume payments or incur costly wage garnishments again after September 30.

Will The Extension Count Towards Loan Forgiveness?

Under the CARES Act, the months of suspended payments count towards loan forgiveness programs, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness, even if no payments are made, as long as the borrower otherwise qualifies and was on track prior to the CARES Act’s implementation. The memorandum, however, does not state whether or not that would continue to be the case during the extension between September 30th and December 31st. If those months do not count, or if the Education Department does not provide clear guidance, borrowers may be faced with a difficult decision to resume normal repayment to maintain progress towards loan forgiveness programs, or continue with suspended payments and risk having those months not be counted.

Trump also signed a memorandum ordering Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to extend student loan relief policies included in the CARES Act that were scheduled to expire on September 30th, through the end of December.

The CARES Act, passed on March 27, paused federal student loan payments and temporarily set the federal student loan interest rate to 0%.

27,"Aug 10, 2020",MarketWatch,‘We’re essentially pushing the pain down the road’: Trump’s order to extend payment freeze on some student loans leaves ‘many unanswered questions’,"President Donald Trump extended the pause on payments and interest for some federal student loans as part of a slew of pandemic-related executive actions issued Saturday, but questions remain about how exactly the pause will be implemented and some borrower advocates say it doesn’t go far enough in providing meaningful relief.

As part of the CARES Act, the coronavirus relief package passed in March, Congress suspended payments and collections and waived interest on federal student loans held by the Department of Education. That pause was scheduled to expire on Sept. 30, about a month before the Presidential election.

In his memo to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, directing her to implement the executive action, Trump wrote that it is “appropriate” to extend the CARES Act policy “until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

The memo states that the payment pause and interest waiver on student loans held by the Department of Education will continue until Dec. 31, 2020.

Though it seems clear that student-loan borrowers who had their payments paused and interest waived through the CARES Act will be able to continue that pause through the end of the year, “we still have a lot of unanswered questions here,” said Ben Miller, vice president for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.

The Department of Education didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on its plans for implementing the executive action.

Outstanding questions

Those questions include, for example, whether the paused payments will count towards the 120 needed for borrowers to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program that allows public servants to have their federal student loans forgiven after 10 years of payments. During the payment pause period covered by the CARES Act, borrowers who are in a qualifying repayment plan are receiving credit as if they were making on time monthly payments.

In addition, it’s unclear whether borrowers who have defaulted on their student loans will have collections paused during the period covered by Trump’s executive action, said Kyra Taylor, a staff attorney focusing on student loans at the National Consumer Law Center. The CARES Act paused wage garnishment and other forms of involuntary collection for these borrowers. Nonetheless, some are still having their paychecks seized.

The mechanics of implementing the executive action are also still fuzzy, Miller said. Will borrowers opt in or opt out of this payment pause? How will student-loan servicers, the companies hired by the Department of Education to be borrowers’ point of contact during the repayment process, actually code this pause into their system?

At the outset of the CARES Act, these companies faced challenges implementing the payment pause and borrower advocates were already worried they’d struggle to deal with a crush of borrowers looking to change repayment plans as the pause lifted. For the past several weeks, these companies have been preparing to transition borrowers back into repayment.

“‘You’re just seeing that executive action is no replacement for real legislation by Congress in this situation’” — Ben Miller, vice president for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress

“As a practical matter it would clearly be so much better and so much easier for Congress to just extend what was in the CARES Act,” Miller said. “You’re just seeing that executive action is no replacement for real legislation by Congress in this situation.”

The Republican-led Senate proposed a coronavirus relief package last month that included a provision which would allow borrowers with no income to stay current on their loans without making payments, an option that is already available in the student-loan program. The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act in May, which extended the CARES Act payment pause until 2021 and provided $10,000 of student debt cancellation for some borrowers.

In addition to the confusion surrounding the President’s executive action, advocates have said it doesn’t go far enough to address the challenges student-loan borrowers are facing during this time. For one, like the CARES Act, it only covers federal student loans that are actually held by the Department of Education. That means at least $165 billion of federal student loans are ineligible for the payment pause, according to Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Savingforcollege.com.

Even for those borrowers that do qualify for the payment pause, “we’re essentially pushing the pain down the road,” said Julie Margetta Morgan, vice president of research at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank.

“What’s going to happen whenever these payments get restarted is that people’s debt burdens are going to be the same as they were at the beginning of the pandemic, but it’s more than likely that their capacity to repay is going to be substantially reduced,” she said.

“In order to provide people real, meaningful relief and to boost the economy, we have to look for some kind of debt cancellation,” she added.

Update: The U.S. Department of Education now says Trump’s suspension can count for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Read more here.

Over the weekend, President Trump extended the student loan repayment suspension for another three months. This is a big win for many student borrowers, but some won’t be so happy.

Borrowers hoping to get Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) won’t benefit from Trump’s executive order as much as other borrowers. The non-payments won’t count because of the way he defers student loan payments. The text of his order reads:

“Sec. 2. Extension of Student Loan Payment Relief. (a) In light of the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, the Secretary of Education shall take action pursuant to applicable law to effectuate appropriate waivers of and modifications to the requirements and conditions of economic hardship deferments described in section 455(f)(2)(D) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1087e(f)(2)(D), and provide such deferments to borrowers as necessary to continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education until December 31, 2020.”

The key words in that text are “economic hardship deferments.” These deferments are available to student borrowers today, but do not count towards the 120 payments required for borrowers to get loans discharged under PSLF.

When Congress suspended student loan payments in the CARES Act, many wondered if the suspension would count towards the number of payments required for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Luckily, Congress included language that said if borrower would have otherwise qualified, the non-payments would count towards forgiveness. So, if a borrower was still employed by a qualified employer, the months of non-payment counted towards PSLF.

But the CARES Act suspension expires on September 30, 2020. This will likely cause a great deal of confusion for many student borrowers. In the midst of a pandemic, many will think Trump’s executive order is an extension of the CARES Act, but it isn’t.

Any borrowers hoping to get PSLF should make their payments after September, otherwise they will be three more payments away from receiving loan forgiveness. They will have the added benefit of suspended interest and will be able to pay down the balance of their loan faster, though most PSLF borrowers aren’t concerned about that.

However, there is still time for Congress to take action and extend the CARES Act benefits. While the enhanced unemployment benefits from the CARES Act have already expired the student loan payment pause lasts through September. Negotiations have stalled, but as the pandemic continues to cost lives and hurt the economy, pressure to make a deal will likely escalate.

This story is developing.

President Donald Trump will suspend your federal student loan payments through December 31, 2020.

Here’s what you need to know.

Student Loans

Trump issued an executive order today that will grant additional student loan relief and provide a payroll tax cut, enhanced unemployment benefits and an eviction moratorium. Trump, who is seeking re-election, sent a memorandum today entitled “Continued Student Loan Payment Relief During the COVID-19 Pandemic” to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Trump ordered DeVos to extend several student loan benefits contained in the Cares Act until December 31, 2020. Congress passed the Cares Act, which is the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill that Congress, in March: Among other benefits, the Cares Act:

paused all payments for federal student loans; set interest rates at 0%, so interest will not accrue on your federal student loans; halted collection of federal student loan debt; and, among other benefits, “counted” non-payment of federal student loan debt toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness.

Trump’s memorandum specifically references “continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education.” However, Trump’s memorandum does not specifically reference student loan debt collection or counting non-payments toward public service loan forgiveness, both of which were included as student loan relief in the Cares Act. The student loan relief included in the Cares Act followed Trump’s executive action earlier this year that provided similar student loan relief for 60 days prior to passage of the Cares Act. Without today’s executive order, this student loan relief was slated to expire on September 30, 2020. Trump wrote that student loan borrowers can continue to make federal student loan payments in the normal course. Trump also noted in the memorandum that many student loan borrowers have continued to make student loan payments over the past five months, despite the temporary pause, to pay off their student loans faster.

“Currently, many Americans remain unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many more have accepted lower wages and reduced hours while States and localities continue to impose social distancing measures,” Trump wrote in the memorandum. “It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

Will I get student loan forgiveness?

Many student loan borrowers are wondering whether Trump’s executive order contains student loans forgiveness. Like the $1 trillion Heals Act that Senate Republicans proposed for the new stimulus package, Trump’s executive order does not include student loan forgiveness. While student loan forgiveness was not expected, borrowers have speculated what Trump’s executive order would mean for student loans during an unprecedented time of unemployment. House Democrats pushed for student loan forgiveness earlier this year in the Heroes Act, but the Republican-led Senate called the Heroes Act “dead on arrival.” Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed student loan forgiveness for 95% of Americans, and Student Debt Crisis, a student loan advocacy non-profit, recently sent Warren a petition signed by 1.2 million people to cancel student loan debt. Among other student loan relief, former Vice President Joe Biden proposed a Covid-19 student loan forgiveness plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower and forgive all undergraduate tuition from two- and four-year public colleges and universities.

How to pay off student loans

Even if your student loans are paused, you will still owe student loan payments when the executive order ends. Plus, private student loans are not paused and are still due. FFELP Loans and Perkins loans not owned by the federal government are also not included. Therefore, make sure you have a game plan to pay off student loans. What’s the best way to start?

Student loan refinancing rates are incredibly cheap","Trump wrote that student loan borrowers can continue to make federal student loan payments in the normal course.
Trump also noted in the memorandum that many student loan borrowers have continued to make student loan payments over the past five months, despite the temporary pause, to pay off their student loans faster.
House Democrats pushed for student loan forgiveness earlier this year in the Heroes Act, but the Republican-led Senate called the Heroes Act “dead on arrival.” Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed student loan forgiveness for 95% of Americans, and Student Debt Crisis, a student loan advocacy non-profit, recently sent Warren a petition signed by 1.2 million people to cancel student loan debt.
Among other student loan relief, former Vice President Joe Biden proposed a Covid-19 student loan forgiveness plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower and forgive all undergraduate tuition from two- and four-year public colleges and universities.

“Currently, many Americans remain unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many more have accepted lower wages and reduced hours while States and localities continue to impose social distancing measures,” the executive order stated. “It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.”

The protections for federally-held student loans were set to expire on September 30, as codified by the CARES Act, and will now extend until December 31, 2020. Private student loans are unaffected by the executive action action.

President Trump said at a news conference on Friday that he plans on issuing an executive order to address expiring student loan relief for millions of Americans under the CARES Act. He provided minimal details, but indicated that student loan payments and interest would continue to be deferred, possibly for an open-ended or indefinite period.

The Trump administration had previously exercised this executive authority in March to temporarily suspend student loan payments and interest at the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic. Congress subsequently codified this in statute via the CARES Act in April.

A U.S. Department of Education spokesperson provided additional context for the legal basis of such an executive order. The spokesperson told Politico that when the President issued his first executive order on student loans in March, the basis for that order was legal authority granted by the Higher Education Act, which confers broad authority on the administration (via the Secretary of Education) to “enforce, pay, compromise, waive, or release” government-held federal student loans.

Consumer rights advocates and members of Congress have previously pointed to this broad authority as a sound legal basis for enacting broad student loan forgiveness, without the need for Congressional intervention. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) indicated during her presidential run that if elected, she would have used this authority to bypass Congress and enact widespread student debt cancellation.

“The Higher Education Act gives the Department of Education the ability to modify, compromise, waive, or release student loans,” Warren wrote. “This authority provides a safety valve for federal student loan programs, letting the Department of Education use its discretion to wipe away loans even when they do not meet the eligibility criteria for more specific cancellation programs like permanent disability discharge.”

Other consumer advocates and student loan experts have argued that using this executive authority to cancel student loan debt is perfectly legal. The Project on Predatory Student Lending noted, “We have consulted the statutory and regulatory framework governing federal student loan programs administered by the Department of Education, as well as the framework and controlling interpretations of the budgetary structure of these programs. We conclude that [Senator Warren’s] proposal calls for a lawful and permissible exercise of the Secretary’s authority under existing law.”

Of course, President Trump has not indicated any support for student loan forgiveness, and there are no indications that he has any plans to include any form of student loan forgiveness in his upcoming executive order. During his administration, President Trump supported a streamlined system for processing disability discharge applications for disabled veterans, but he opposed bipartisan legislation that would have eased the process of student loan forgiveness for borrowers defrauded by their schools. Republicans in Congress have also rejected Democratic calls for broad cancelation of student loan debt as a form of economic stimulus.

In addition, any executive order granting widespread student loan forgiveness could face legal challenges. Other stakeholders (such as student loan servicers and debt collectors) could potentially challenge such a sweeping reinterpretation of federal regulations in court, arguing that it goes beyond what Congress intended when it wrote the Higher Education Act. If there is a legal challenge, any student loan forgiveness could potentially be halted by injunction until there is a final decision by a federal court.

Nevertheless, President Trump’s reliance on the Higher Education Act’s authority to enact executive action providing broad student loan relief could be cited as precedent in the future — by this administration, or a future one — to enact more sweeping unilateral student loan relief.

Student loan forgiveness is top of mind for 45 million student loan borrowers, but will it really stimulate the economy?

Here’s what you need to know.

Student Loan Forgiveness

Student loan forgiveness has taken center stage in congressional legislation and presidential campaigns alike. A few recent examples:

Heroes Act: The Heroes Act — the $3 trillion stimulus package that House Democrats passed — initially proposed $10,000 of student loan forgiveness for your federal student loans and $10,000 of private student loan forgiveness. However, House Democrats passed the Heroes Act with a weaker provision that would cancel $10,000 of student loan debt only for borrowers who are struggling financially (rather than every student loan borrower).

Joe Biden: Former Vice President Joe Biden reiterated his support for student loan forgiveness and his support to discharge student loans in bankruptcy.

Senate Democrats: Senate Democrats have proposed to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt.

House Democrats: House Democrats, led by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) proposed to cancel $30,000 of student loan debt.

Cancel Student Loan Debt: The COVID-19 Student 5 Loan Relief Act of 2020 would make it easier to cancel both private student loans and federal student loans, and would be available to all Americans impacted by Covid-19.

Coronavirus: The Medical Bankruptcy Fairness Act would allow you to cancel your student loans in bankruptcy and provide relief to student loan borrowers who are struggling to make student loan payments.

Cancel Student Loans Petition: Student Debt Crisis, a leading student loan advocacy not-profit, recently sent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) a petition for student loan forgiveness with 1.2 million signatures.

Despite these proposals, Congress has not passed any student loan forgiveness. U.S. Secretary of Education recently revamped a student loan forgiveness tool, but does not support outright student loan forgiveness for borrowers. Similarly, the Heals Act — the $1 trillion stimulus package that Senate Republicans proposed — does not include any student loan forgiveness. What does the next stimulus package mean for your student loans? As Congress crafts the next stimulus with second stimulus checks and unemployment benefits, it’s likely that student loan forgiveness will not be included. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) proposed a new student loan repayment plan that would help borrowers without income make no student loan payments until they earn income. For those student loan borrowers with income, Alexander’s plan includes student loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of student loan payments. However, this student loan forgiveness proposal is similar to current income-driven repayment plans.

Does student loan forgiveness stimulate the economy?

What proponents say:

Given this focus on student loans, would student loan forgiveness stimulate the economy? Proponents argue that student loan debt is a major financial crisis. According to the latest student loan debt statistics, 45 million student loan borrowers collectively owe $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. They argue that student loan debt has materially impacted borrowers’ ability to buy a home, save for retirement, get married and start a family. Proponents say that cancelling student loan debt, in part or in whole, would stimulate the economy and provide necessary financial relief to millions of Americans. Proponents also argue this: By freeing up money that otherwise would go toward student loan repayment, borrowers will have excess capital to spend in the economy.

What opponents say:

Opponents cite several reasons why they don’t support student loan forgiveness. This includes that student loan forgiveness is too expensive for the federal government and taxpayers, and that student loan forgiveness is not the optimal way to stimulate the economy. According to the Urban Institute, opponents also say that student loan forgiveness is not “a cost-effective form of stimulus and would direct the most benefits to higher-income households.” The authors make several points regarding why student loan forgiveness would not stimulate the economy in the near-term. According to the authors:

Little Economic Impact: If a borrower has $30,000 of student loan debt, the borrower would pay about $300 a month over 10 years. If the borrower received $10,000 of student loan forgiveness today, that would provide $100 of additional monthly spending over the next 10 years. That’s not much of an immediate economic impact compared with giving each student loan borrower $10,000 upfront to spend in the economy.

If a borrower has $30,000 of student loan debt, the borrower would pay about $300 a month over 10 years. If the borrower received $10,000 of student loan forgiveness today, that would provide $100 of additional monthly spending over the next 10 years. That’s not much of an immediate economic impact compared with giving each student loan borrower $10,000 upfront to spend in the economy. Income, Not Balance: The authors point out that student loan repayment is based on income, not student loan balance. For borrowers on income-driven repayment plans, their monthly payment would not be reduced materially if their student loan balance was reduced by $10,000, for example. Why? Income-driven repayment plans are based primarily on income, with some monthly payments as low as $0. In these cases, borrowers would be unlikely to spend more in the economy today and therefore would not provide immediate economic stimulus.

The authors note that borrowers with the lowest incomes could benefit from student loan debt cancellation. The authors also argue that stimulus checks to 90% of Americans is a more effective way to stimulate the economy than student loan forgiveness, which impacts a smaller constituency.

How to pay off student loans

What’s next for your student loans? The new stimulus package is expected next week, if Congress can agree on a bi-partisan basis. The next stimulus is not expected to include student loan forgiveness. Absent Congress extending the student loan benefits from the Cares Act, student loan payments will resume on October 1, 2020. Importantly, don’t wait for Congress to act. Make sure you have your own game plan to pay off student loans. Even if there is student loan relief available, it doesn’t mean that you should ignore your student loans. What’s the best way to start? Start with these four options, all of which have no fees:

Millions of student loan borrowers are anxiously waiting for news regarding whether there will be additional or extended student loan relief as part of a second major stimulus bill.

Congress passed the CARES Act in April in the wake of the rapid economic collapse brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the implementation of the CARES Act has been messy, the CARES Act provided substantial relief to student loan borrowers. The stimulus bill suspended payments, interest, and collections on all government-held federal student loans.

But this student loan relief ends on September 30th. This month, the U.S. Department of Education will start sending out notices to millions of borrowers letting them know that they will have to resume their payments soon — even as many Americans remain in financially precarious positions.

Congressional leaders in the House and the Senate, as well as White House officials, have been engaged in discussions about a possible new stimulus bill. But the parties remain far apart, and it is unclear what, if any, relief may come next.

Student loan borrowers can expect one of these five possible scenarios to become a reality within the next two months.

Scenario One: Congress Passes the HEROES Act

House Democrats passed the HEROES Act in May, which would extend the CARES Act’s student loan payment and interest suspension for an additional 12 months. The HEROES Act would also expand the CARES Act’s protections to include commercially-issued FFEL-program federal student loans, as well as federal Perkins loans. The bill would also provide $10,000 in federal and private student loan forgiveness to borrowers experiencing economic distress. House Democrats recently passed a separate bill that would also suspend private student loan payments for 12 months.

In order for the HEROES Act to become law, however, the Senate would have to pass it as well, and the President would have to sign on. Senate Republican leaders rejected the HEROES Act without even allowing a vote on it.

Likelihood of happening: Very low.

Scenario Two: Congress Passes HEALS Act

The Senate came up with its own stimulus proposal, distinct from the HEROES Act. The Senate GOP proposal, called the HEALS Act, includes a proposal to simplify the federal student loan repayment system. The plan would include an income-driven repayment option that would allow student loan borrowers earning no income to have no monthly payment obligation, while other borrowers would have to pay 10% of their discretionary income towards their student loans.

However, this proposal is virtually identical to existing income-driven repayment plans. The HEALS Act includes no extension of the student loan relief provided by the CARES Act, and no student loan forgiveness. Because of this, House Democratic leaders oppose the bill, saying it does not go far enough. House Democrats would have to approve any bill passed by the Senate. There are indications, however, than even Republican senators do not fully support the HEALS Act.

Likelihood of happening: Very low.

Scenario Three: Congress Compromises

While House Democrats and Senate Republicans remain far apart on stimulus talks, negotiations are continuing, and it is very possible they could find common ground to compromise in time for the September 30th expiration of the CARES Act protections. While Republicans have shown little interest in enacting broad student loan forgiveness, some congressional Republicans have indicated an openness to extending the CARES Act’s student loan relief.

A GOP congressman introduced legislation extending the suspension of payments and interest through the end of 2020. While this three-month extension is far shorter than the 12-months suggested by House Democrats, and it would not include any student loan forgiveness, it would buy student loan borrowers some additional months of suspended payments and interest, while effectively punting any further relief to the next Congress after the election.

Likelihood of happening: Possible.

Scenario Four: Executive Action by President Trump

President Trump said at a recent press briefing that his administration is potentially considering extending the current moratorium on federal student loan payments. “We... suspended student loan payments for six months, and we’re looking to do that additionally and for additional periods of time,” he said. Trump provided no further details.

With his re-election at stake, President Trump is likely very much aware of the political fallout that would occur when millions of student loan borrowers receive bills and demands for payment merely days prior to the November election. President Trump provided student loan relief via executive order in March, prior to the CARES Act’s passage, when his administration enacted a temporary emergency interest freeze and payment suspension on government-held federal student loans. Congress subsequently codified and extended that student loan relief in statute when it passed the CARES Act.

It is possible that if Congress cannot reach a compromise, the Trump administration could act unilaterally and enact a new executive order extending the existing student loan payment suspension and interest freeze. This would likely be a limited extension designed to get the administration through the November elections.

Likelihood of happening: Possible.

Scenario Five: No Further Student Loan Relief

If Congress does not reach a compromise on extending student loan relief, and President Trump does not act through an executive order, then the CARES Act’s student loan relief provisions will end on September 30, 2020. Billing will resume, and borrowers should expect their next billing date to be in late October or early November. Interest will start accruing again. And collections activities on defaulted federal student loans that were previously suspended — such as wage garnishments and seizure of federal tax refunds — will resume, as well.

Many student loan borrowers will be outraged or unable to pay in October and November, just as they are about to cast their vote in the November elections. Lawmakers therefore have a powerful incentive to reach some sort of compromise. But if they don’t, borrowers may have no choice but to resume normal repayment, regardless of economic circumstances. Here’s what to do if Congress doesn’t extend student loan relief.

Likelihood of happening: Lower, but possible.

The new stimulus package has one major proposal for your student loans.

Here’s what you need to know—and how it may impact you.

Student Loans: stimulus package

If you’re hoping for student loan forgiveness today or a complete pause of your federal student loans for another six months, you won’t find it in the new $1 trillion stimulus package that Republicans proposed last month. The Heals Act, if passed in its current form, would include the following:

Student Loan Repayment

Proposal: Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, proposed a new student loan repayment plan that, among other things, provides student loan relief to borrowers without income.

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, proposed a new student loan repayment plan that, among other things, provides student loan relief to borrowers without income. No income, no payment: If you have no income, you would make no federal student loan payments.

If you have no income, you would make no federal student loan payments. If Income: If you have income, your monthly federal student loan payments would be based on 10% of discretionary income.

Student Loan Forgiveness

Can I get student loan forgiveness? Under this plan, there is student loan forgiveness, but it won’t be upfront.

Under this plan, there is student loan forgiveness, but it won’t be upfront. Income-Driven Repayment: Like current income-driven repayment plans, you can receive student loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years for your federal student loans.

Student Loans: proponents like this

Proponents of Alexander’s plan give several reasons for supporting the proposed legislation.

Student Loan Relief: First, the stimulus package includes some relief for student loan borrowers, even if it’s less than what many had hoped. The focus on other economic priorities ranging from second stimulus checks to unemployment checks shifted the focus from student loans. Senate Republicans could have scrapped any student loan relief in the Heals Act. Struggling Financially: Second, Alexander’s proposal focuses on student borrowers who are struggling financially. The Cares Act, the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that Congress passed in March, focused on most borrowers with federal student loans - regardless of the borrower’s financial situation. In contrast, Alexander’s plan caters to Americans who have no income and therefore can’t make any student loan payments. Student Loan Forgiveness: Third, while Alexander’s plan provides no wide-scale student loan forgiveness, borrowers can qualify for federal student loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years. Student Loan Payments: Fourth, like the Cares Act, the months in which a borrower pays $0 in student loan payments will count toward the 20 or 25 years for student loan forgiveness. Simpler Repayment: Alexander’s plan would simplify the nine existing federal student loan repayment plans with two options, namely no payments if you have no income or 10% of discretionary income if you have income.

Student Loans: opponents don’t like this

Opponents of Alexander’s plan give several reasons why they object to the proposed legislation.

Not Enough: First, opponents argue that the student loan relief is a fraction of what Congress passed in the Cares Act. Opponents say that Americans are struggling in the worst economy since the Great Depression. Millions have lost jobs, face potential eviction and are battling the uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, opponents say that Americans need more immediate student loan relief. Cares Act: Opponents want the student loan benefits in the Cares Act extended for one year, from September 30, 2020 to September 30, 2021. This includes pausing all payments for federal student loans, setting interest rates at 0%, halting collection of federal student loan debt and “counting” non-payment of federal student loan debt toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness. Income-Driven Repayment: Third, opponents say that Alexander’s student loan forgiveness proposal is too similar to existing student loan forgiveness that is included in income-driven repayment plans. Democrats may support fewer income-driven repayment plans to avoid confusion and bureaucracy, but they prefer a more innovative approach. Student Loan Forgiveness: House Democrats want $10,000 of student loan forgiveness included in the next stimulus. However, when House Democrats passed the Heroes Act, a $3 trillion stimulus package that has not passed the Senate, immediate student loan forgiveness only would apply to borrowers who are struggling financially. Therefore, under the Heroes Act, student loan forgiveness would not be available to every student loan borrower.

How to pay off student loans

Absent an extension from Congress, student loan payments will resume on October 1, 2020. Whether Congress extends the Cares Act or adopts Alexander’s plan, make sure you have your own game plan to pay off student loans. Even if there is student loan relief available, it doesn’t mean that you should ignore your student loans. What’s the best way to start? Start with these four options, all of which have no fees:

36,"Aug 3, 2020",Forbes,Will Biden Really Deliver Student Loan Forgiveness?,"In early July, Joe Biden released a plan for free college and student loan forgiveness that Bernie Sanders supports should love.

Specifically, Biden’s plans call for two years of free community college for anyone who wants to pursue an associate degree or career training at an accredited institution.

Further, he wants to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families who earn less than $125,000, which is ironically the same cutoff Hillary Clinton chose for her student loan plans during her Presidential run in 2016. Biden’s college funding and student loan strategy would also beef up Pell grants that can make higher education more affordable.

When it comes to those with existing loans, there are some goodies here, too. Under Biden’s plan, anyone making under $25,000 per year wouldn’t be required to make payments on their student loans at all, and everyone else would only be required to fork over 5% of their discretionary income (which is income minus taxes and essential spending like housing and food) on amounts earned over the $25,000 annual threshold.

But it’s important to note: Biden is not suggesting the cancellation of all student loan debt, which currently sits at around $1.6 trillion. His plan could make college free for most students going forward, and it would drastically reduce the burden of students who are struggling to make payments on their existing debts by modifying repayment plans.

There’s a lot more to Biden’s plan than what we can outline here, but you can read about all of his proposals on his website. The problem with Biden’s plan is that, like other plans from similar candidates, all this reform is expensive.

Not only that, but you can’t snap your fingers and make college free. Someone has to pay for it, and the only way to fund this kind of program is through higher taxes on everyone.

Is Student Loan Forgiveness A Real Possibility?

Believe it or not, but Biden’s student loan plan actually has quite a bit of support. Biden released a giant document with more details on various plans for the economy, the environment, and higher education in early July, and it’s been reported that this plan was put together by various joint task forces, including supporters of Bernie Sanders.

But no matter where you stand on the issue, it would take a lot for any of these proposals for free college or large scale loan forgiveness to pass. Keep in mind that the HEROES Act barely passed the Democrat-controlled House with 14 members voting against it. This act hasn’t been voted on in the Senate, who plans to vote on another version of a relief bill this week, so it’s likely dead in the water. However, the HEROES Act only included $10,000 in loan forgiveness for private student loans and $10,000 in loan forgiveness for federal loans.

By and large, this suggests that Democratic leaders may not offer unanimous support for a college funding and loan repayment plan as broad as Biden’s. And, if any loan forgiveness is offered at all, it’s likely to be offered on a limited basis, or for lower amounts nearing the $10,000 mark.

Don’t Count On Loan Forgiveness, Do This Instead

It remains to be seen whether Biden will be elected to President at all. And even if he does win the Presidency, we could spend years waiting to see if any student loan forgiveness plans come to fruition.

In the meantime, your federal student loan payments will once again be due after the forbearance for Covid-19 ends on September 30, 2020. At that point, interest will begin accruing, and you’ll be left in the same position you were before the CARES Act temporarily paused student loan payments.

While you can absolutely wait to worry about your loans during this period of forbearance, there are plenty of things you can do in a few months to make your loans less of a burden. Instead of waiting on loan forgiveness, consider these options:

Switch your repayment plan. A lot of people have no idea that you can switch the repayment plan on federal student loans and repay your balance for up to 25 years (or 30 years with consolidation loans). Having a payment to make for this long isn’t ideal, but you can drastically lower your monthly payment when you extend your repayment timeline.

Having a payment to make for this long isn’t ideal, but you can drastically lower your monthly payment when you extend your repayment timeline. Look into income-driven repayment plans. Make sure to check out income-driven repayment plans like PAYE and IBR. Plans in this category work for federal student loans, and they let you pay just a percentage of your “discretionary income” for 20 to 25 years before forgiving your remaining balances completely. As a side note, forgiven loan amounts are treated as taxable income, so these plans may leave you with a big tax bill later on.

Also check whether refinancing your student loans with a private lender makes sense. Many student loan companies offer much lower fixed or variable interest rates than federal loans when you have good credit, which could help you secure a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, or both.

Explore existing loan forgiveness options. Also make sure to consider all the existing student loan forgiveness plans out there, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and loan forgiveness for teachers. Once you start digging, you’ll find there are plenty of forgiveness plans geared to specific careers (like law and medicine), forgiveness plans for military members and more. It’s possible you could already qualify for a plan you aren’t even aware of.

The Bottom Line

The student loan crisis will likely get a lot worse in this country before it gets better, and it’s fairly unlikely we’ll see broad scale loan forgiveness any time soon. While you can still hold out hope, my advice is to take steps now to reduce your burden while you pay off your debt.

It’s possible a new repayment plan could help lessen your financial load every month, and the change you need may require less work than you think. If loan forgiveness never becomes law, you’ll be much better off than you would be if you waited it out.","In early July, Joe Biden released a plan for free college and student loan forgiveness that Bernie Sanders supports should love.

Congress and the Trump administration are currently negotiating the next stimulus package and there are several options for student loan relief on the table.

Payments and interest on federally-held student loans are currently suspended through September 30, 2020. Some private student loan holders have received similar payment pauses depending on who holds the loan and different state laws, though many have not.

Student borrowers should be attentive to what Congress and the administration settle on, as it could greatly impact their finances. Here are some of the options currently being considered for the next stimulus package.

Let the extension expire and provide income-driven repayment.

Senate Republicans have proposed allowing the extension to expire. Instead, they are offering borrowers a new income-driven repayment plan—similar to existing repayment plans—that would not require borrowers to pay if they had no income.

Extend the student loan payment suspension.

Many others are calling for an extension of the repayment pause. Multiple proposals have been put forth to do so. House Democrats passed a bill in May that would extend the suspension for another year. A House Republican proposed suspending payments, but just through the end of the year.

Provide student loan forgiveness.

Others have called for student loan forgiveness. Earlier this spring, Senator Elizabeth Warren led a call with other Senate Democrats calling for Congress to make payments for borrowers through the coronavirus emergency and provide a minimum of $10,000 in student loan forgiveness. Former Vice President Joe Biden has adopted that plan for his campaign platform. Some progressives have called for more forgiveness.

As negotiations continue, borrowers should be sure to pay attention. The student loan suspension is set to end next month so if payments resume, borrowers need to be ready and plan ahead.

Borrowers who took out federal student loans with higher rates several years ago may consider refinancing to save money while rates are low.

However, experts agree that it's not the time to refinance. Federal student loans are currently in forbearance, and no payments are due until September 30.

Refinancing involves switching your loans from federal student loans to private student loans, losing assistance programs like income driven repayment. It would also require paying on loans again, and missing out on the chance to bulk up your emergency fund with the savings.

This advice only applies to federal loans. If you have private student loans you want to refinance, now is a good time.

Learn more about getting or refinancing a student loan with CommonBond »

Refinancing student loans to save money is a no-brainer for people with private loans, or those who have already refinanced their federal loans into private. With interest rates low right now, the potential for saving money could be huge.

To refinance your student loans, you move your loans from one lender to another, generally at a better interest rate: from federal to private, or from one private company to another. Either way, refinanced loans are always held by private lenders.

But borrowers with federal student loans, which are in forbearance until September 30 as stipulated by the CARES Act, should think twice before refinancing right now. With interest rates set to 0%, student loans aren't accruing any interest, and automatic payments have been put on pause. For now, student loans are essentially frozen in time, and it might be best for them to stay that way.

Once you refinance, you lose valuable protections

Student loan expert and personal finance author David Carlson says refinancing before the federal student loan forbearance ends comes with a major risk: losing the protections of income-driven repayment plans, loan forgiveness, and more.

The federal student loan program has safety nets built in that you lose when you refinance. Some of those safety nets include the federal forbearance that currently applies to all borrowers due to the coronavirus pandemic. Income-driven repayment plans, which limits student loan payments to a percentage of your income, pay as you earn plans, and public service loan forgiveness could also be critical for people who have lost work during the pandemic, or face uncertainty going forward.

Private student loan borrowers don't have these options available. While private student lenders can also offer some assistance — some have launched their own plans to help borrowers affected by the coronavirus pandemic — it's not the same level of protection.

If you refinance, Carlson says, ""there's really no going back. It's something that you can't undo, and you do lose those protections."" Just because you don't need these safety nets today doesn't mean you won't tomorrow. Losing them due to refinancing could be a big missed opportunity in uncertain times.

You'll likely have to pay your loans again if you refinance

If your income hasn't been drastically affected by the pandemic — likely the case if you're considering refinancing — you'll have to start paying your loans again after making the switch. And, that money could be put to better use.

""I think it's a big, rare opportunity to beef up your savings and increase an emergency fund,"" Carlson says. Keeping cash on hand could be the best line of defense you have against taking on high-interest debt if you find yourself unemployed, or lose income.""Give yourself a little more breathing room, especially with how unpredictable things have been since March and could be going into next year,"" he says.

Cait Howerton, a senior financial coach at SmartPath, says your priorities should depend on where you are financially. For people who don't have any high-interest debt, and who have a full emergency fund and a steady income, ""start accelerating your student loan payoff,"" she suggests. ""Right now, interest isn't accruing, and it's a perfect time to really make some traction on the principal.""

For people with high-interest debt, using the money that would have gone towards student loans to pay off that debt might be a smarter move. And for anyone without an emergency fund, Howerton says it's time to start one. ""If you don't have at least a three-month emergency fund, that has to be on your mind,"" she says.

Since interest isn't accruing and borrowers aren't required to pay, keeping your money and leaving federal student loans in forbearance is generally safer, and maybe smarter, than refinancing. ""You can't do any better than 0% interest, even with refinancing,"" Howerton says.","Borrowers who took out federal student loans with higher rates several years ago may consider refinancing to save money while rates are low.

39,"Jul 30, 2020",Fox Business,Should I consolidate my student loans?,"Many students graduate with multiple student loans, often from different lenders. This can make the repayment process more complicated, but there's an option to fix it: You can consolidate student loan debt.

A Direct Consolidation Loan is a specific type of federal student loan available if you already have federal student debt or loans issued by the Department of Education (DOE). You'll need to apply online with the DOE for a Direct Consolidation Loan and you can use it to repay one or more of your existing government loans including Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, and PLUS Loans.

Unfortunately, if you have private student loans -- those from banks, credit unions, or online lenders -- you can't use a Direct Consolidation Loan to combine them. You could, however, take out a new student loan refinance loan with a private lender to repay one or more of them. This will have the effect of consolidating your loans since you're combining them into one big new loan -- but it could also change your interest rate and repayment terms.

What is student loan consolidation?

Student loan consolidation is a specific process you can complete only if you have federal loans from the Department of Education.

It involves getting a new Direct Consolidation Loan from the DOE and using it to repay one or more existing federal loans. In fact, although it's called consolidation, you can actually get a Direct Consolidation Loan even if you have just a single federal student loan to repay.

Consolidation will not change your interest rate, as your new loans will have a rate based on a weighted average of your old ones. But consolidation can open up the door to more flexible repayment options.

8 OF THE BEST PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS IN 2020

What's the difference between consolidating and refinancing?

Consolidating means taking out a Direct Consolidation Loan to repay existing debt for the purposes of changing your loan servicer, loan terms, or both.

Refinancing also involves getting a new loan and using it to pay off existing student debt, often combining multiple old loans into one new one. But refinance loans aren't available from the government; they only come from private lenders. Online marketplace Credible can help you compare deals from various private vendors to ensure you find the best offer for you.

Banks, credit unions, and online lenders all offer student loan refinance options but typically only to people with good credit and proof of sufficient income to repay the debt.

Refinancing is the only way to change payment terms -- including your interest rate and payment timeline -- on private loans. But it typically makes sense only if you can get a new loan at a lower rate. Otherwise, your payoff could be much more expensive. Credible makes it easy to view a rates table that compares rates from multiple lenders at once so you can see if you're able to qualify for a new low-cost loan.

4 PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN TIPS FOR UNDERGRADS

It's also possible to use a private student loan refinance loan to repay federal loans, but doing so means giving up the chance at loan forgiveness and losing the borrower benefits that federal loans provide.

Pros and cons of consolidating student loans

There are both advantages and disadvantages to consolidation.

You'll reset your deferment and forbearance options. Since your consolidated loan is a new one, you'll be fully eligible for deferment and forbearance again even if you had paused payments under your old loan.

Since your consolidated loan is a new one, you'll be fully eligible for deferment and forbearance again even if you had paused payments under your old loan. You could become eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). For Public Service Loan Forgiveness to result in anything being forgiven, you need to make at least 120 on-time payments. For parents with PLUS Loans, the only available repayment options would pay off the loan in 10 years -- before forgiveness becomes available. A consolidated loan provides parents with an income-driven option so they can take advantage of PSLF.

Cons

Consolidating could slightly raise your interest rate. A refinance loan with a private lender could reduce the rate you pay (Credible provides an online student loan refinancing calculator to estimate your new payment cost). However, a Direct Consolidation Loan won't reduce your rate. In fact, when you consolidate, your new rate is determined by a weighted average of rates on the debt, rounded up to the nearest 1/8 of a percent. That means your new rate could be slightly higher.

STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES AT HISTORIC LOWS — HOW TO SAVE MONEY BY REFINANCING

When does it make sense to consolidate student loans?

Consolidation makes sense if your goal is to:

Combine multiple federal loans into one but not pay off private student loans with your new loan.

Gain access to extended repayment plans that allow you to repay loans for as long as 30 years.

Make Parent PLUS Loans eligible for an income-driven repayment plan and for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

You can qualify for a Direct Consolidation Loan regardless of your credit score. You'll need to apply on the Department of Education website and provide details on which federal loans you're consolidating.

How to know if you should consolidate your student loans

You may want to consolidate loans if:

You're having difficulty managing loans with multiple servicers and you want one monthly payment.

You'd prefer more flexibility in your options for repayment including longer repayment periods.

You're no longer eligible for deferment and you want to restart the clock.

Senator Kamala Harris is making the case for Congress to adopt her priorities for the next stimulus package, including $2,000 monthly stimulus checks and student loan forgiveness.

Last night, Harris—who is a top Democratic vice presidential contender—joined Joy Reid on her new show, The ReidOut, and pitched former Vice President Joe Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan for economic recovery and racial equality. Harris specifically highlighted the part of his plan that includes broad $10,000 student loan forgiveness for borrowers with federal student loans due to the coronavirus.

Senator Harris also spoke to Biden’s proposal to make public colleges and historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs)—even private HBCUs—tuition-free for families making up to $125,000 annually.

Last week, Harris joined other Democratic Senators in calling for the next stimulus package to include a fix to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program that would make it easier for borrowers to benefit from the program. The senators cited the many essential workers who are also working in public service and would be eligible for the program.

Senator Harris is also asking for more direct cash payments to Americans. Her bill with Senators Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey would provide $2,000 stimulus checks and make them monthly. Individuals would also receive $2,000 per dependent, up to $6,000.

The last stimulus check was just a one-time payment of up to $1,200 per individual and $500 per dependent. For those making more than $75,000 annually, that amount was reduced. Senate Republicans have proposed another round of stimulus checks very similar to the first one.

Harris has also proposed the Rent Emergencies Leave Impacts on Evicted Families (RELIEF) Act that would ban evictions and foreclosures for a year to protect renters and homeowners as they weather the economic crisis. She has introduced additional legislation to shield Americans from having their utilities shut off during the emergency.

41,"Jul 28, 2020",MarketWatch,"No income, no student loan payment? GOP proposal draws skepticism","Senate Republicans included a permanent change aimed at easing the burden of student loan repayments in their initial stab at another big coronavirus aid bill currently being negotiated in Congress. But student-borrower advocates gave the idea a thumbs down.

Pushed by Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who heads the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the proposal would consolidate the current nine different student loan repayment programs down to only two.

“In March, Congress agreed that 43 million Americans who have student loans would not have to pay a monthly payment until October 1,” Alexander said.

“October 1 is just around the corner, so what we propose is if you have no income, you have no monthly payments. If you do have income, then we change the student loan payment system, so that you never have to pay more than 10% of your income after you’ve deducted the necessities of life, like mortgage and food.”

The 10% would only apply to income above 150% of the federal poverty level, now $19,140 annually for an individual. Borrowers making less than that would have no monthly payments.

In addition to the income-based plan, Alexander’s proposal would allow a standard, mortgage-style 10-year repayment plan as well.

Overhauling the student loan system has long been a priority for lawmakers, particularly as they have looked at rewriting the Higher Education Act that underpins most federal law about colleges and universities.

But consensus has been hard to reach between Democrats and Republicans and the proposal by Alexander, who is retiring from Congress, is notable in that it, unlike other parts of Senate Republicans’ package of bills, it would be a permanent change and not a temporary change tied to virus epidemic.

Student-borrower advocates, though, remained unimpressed.

For one, it wouldn’t extend the March CARES Act pause on student-loan payments, collections and interest accrual. Advocates have worried for months that student-loan borrowers aren’t ready to resume payments on their debt given the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic that is still ongoing.

That payments and collections will resume will have particularly devastating consequences for borrowers who have defaulted on their student loans, a demographic Alexander’s proposal leaves out, said Persis Yu, the director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at the National Consumer Law Center.

“Borrowers are going to start getting collection calls from debt collectors on October 1,” Yu said. In addition, under the proposal, the Department of Education can presumably resume using its extraordinary collection powers to recover defaulted student loans, including through wage garnishment and offsetting of Social Security benefits and tax refunds, Yu said.

“Which is nuts, there’s still a pandemic raging around,” she said.

Many of these borrowers experienced a delay in receiving the benefits of the CARES Act, with the Department still garnishing wages and tax refunds even weeks into the collections pause period.

For borrowers who are current on their loans, Alexander’s proposal offers less flexibility than what’s already available, Yu said. The current system includes a suite of repayment plans with several that allow borrowers to pay back their loans as a percentage of their income with the option of forgiveness after a certain number of years of repayment.

The complexity of the system has been a source of concern for borrower advocates for years and addressing it has been a goal of Alexander’s for some time, but his proposal eliminates some of the choices borrowers have in the current system, Yu said.

For example, right now married student-loan borrowers who file their taxes separately from their spouse can opt for a repayment plan that evaluates only their own income instead of including their spouses as well. Under Alexander’s proposal that option is eliminated.

Under the current system, some borrowers with debt from graduate school can use a repayment plan that allows their debt to be canceled after 20 years of payments tied to income. Under Alexander’s plan, borrowers with graduate school debt need to make payments for 25 years to receive forgiveness.

Current student loan borrowers who like their repayment plan can keep it under Alexander’s proposal, but borrowers who enter repayment after October 1 would have to choose from the new options. Current student loan borrowers who are working towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness — a program that allows public servants to have their federal student debt forgiven after 120 payments — would face a penalty under Alexander’s proposal if they switch repayment plans.

“It’s a worse version of what we already have,” Yu said of Alexander’s proposal.

There also may be challenges in implementing Alexander’s plan. Borrower advocates have complained for years that student-loan companies don’t do enough to make sure borrowers end up in the most affordable repayment plan to which they’re entitled. They were already concerned that student-loan companies would be slammed with calls to switch repayment plans once the CARES Act payment pause ended.

Under typical circumstances, switching repayment plans can take several weeks for borrowers. “There is no way you can create a new repayment plan in two months,” Yu said.

Senate Republicans released their stimulus package yesterday.

Here’s what you need to know.

Student Loans

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and multiple senators introduced the Heals Act (Health, Economic Assistance Liability Protection & Schools Act), a ~$1 trillion stimulus package proposal. The stimulus package includes, among other initiatives, second stimulus checks, unemployment benefits, school funding and more Payment Protection Program (PPP) funding. The Heals Act also includes some student loan relief, but not what you may think. Let’s dive in.

Student Loans: what’s in the new stimulus?

If you’re expecting significant student loan relief, you won’t find it inside the new stimulus. Here’s what Senate Republicans proposed for your student loans:

New Proposal

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) proposed a new student loan repayment plan.

No Student Loan Payments

If you have no income, you would make no student loan payments.

Student Loan Repayment

If you have income, your monthly student loan payments would be based on 10% of discretionary income.

Student Loan Forgiveness

Like current income-driven repayment plans, you can receive student loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years.

Like the Cares Act (the $2.2 trillion stimulus package), the months in which you pay $0 will count toward the 20 or 25 years for student loan forgiveness.

Alexander’s plan would apply to both existing and new student loan borrowers, and likely is limited to federal student loans only. Alexander’s plan would replace the nine current student loan repayment plans with these two options (no payments or 10% of discretionary income), and thereby provide simpler student loan repayment.

Your student loan benefits could end September 30, 2020

The Cares Act provides multiple benefits for your student loans, including:

pause all payments for federal student loans set interest rates at 0%, so interest will not accrue on your federal student loans halt collection of federal student loan debt “count” non-payment of federal student loan debt toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness.

Absent an extension, these student loan benefits will expire on September 30, 2020. This means that your student loan payments would resume as early as October 1, 2020. Will your student loan benefits from the Cares Act end on September 30, 2020? It’s too early to tell, but based on the Heals Act, the answer could be yes. There doesn’t appear to be a proposal in the Republican stimulus package to extend these student loan benefits beyond September 30.

Will I get student loan forgiveness?

Like the Cares Act, the Heals Act does not include outright student loan forgiveness. There is student loan forgiveness through an income-driven repayment plan after 20 or 25 years (similar to current income-driven repayment plans), but nothing that would cancel student loan debt today. House Democrats proposed in the Heroes Act — the $3 trillion stimulus bill that passed the House, but not the Senate — $10,000 of student loan forgiveness for borrowers who are struggling financially. However, student loan forgiveness doesn’t appear in the Heals Act. Senators such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have called for student loan forgiveness for 95% of Americans, and also supported other congressional proposals to forgive $10,000 of student loan debt. Student Debt Crisis, a student loan advocacy non-profit, recently sent Warren a petition signed by 1.2 million people calling for student loan forgiveness. Former Vice President Joe Biden proposed a Covid-19 student loan forgiveness plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower. Biden would forgive all undergraduate tuition from two- and four-year public colleges and universities. Biden also would forgive all undergraduate tuition for borrowers who earn $125,000 or less per year and who graduate from a private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU’s) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI’s).

Next Steps

In the Heroes Act, Democrats want to extend student loan relief in the Cares Act for one year, through September 30, 2021. Senate Republicans were willing to agree to student loan relief in March, but now they believe the economy is on relatively stronger footing than during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Democrats disagree, and argue that more than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits and need financial assistance in one of the worst economic environments since the Great Depression. Based on this key timeline for the new stimulus, Congress likely will finalize the next stimulus package by August 7, but it’s also possible Congress doesn’t reach consensus by then. If not, Congress begins summer recess on August 8 and does not return until September 8.

How to pay off student loans

If Congress adopts this student loan proposal, make sure you’re prepared. If the Cares Act student loan relief is not extended beyond September 30, then your student loan payments could resume starting October 1. Make sure you have a game plan to pay off student loans. What’s the best way to start? Start with these four options, all of which have no fees:

44,"Jul 28, 2020",CNBC,Here's how the latest GOP coronavirus relief proposal would impact student loans,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to threaten the physical and financial health of Americans across the country, Senate Republicans introduced the ""Safely Back to Work and Back to School Act.""

The bill, introduced by Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander Monday, includes a section on student loan repayment that would streamline or eliminate several federal student loan repayment options that borrowers are currently able to choose from.

Currently, student loan borrowers can choose from nine repayment options. The proposed bill would cut back these options to include just two: a mortgage-style repayment plan with a fixed annual amount paid over 10 years or less and an income-based plan where borrowers pay 10% of their discretionary income.

The income-based plan would define discretionary income as family income above 150% of the poverty line. Borrowers with undergraduate debt will have their balance forgiven after 20 years and borrowers with graduate school debt will have their balance forgiven after 25 years.

Importantly, the bill would allow borrowers to keep their current repayment plan if they wish and would allow borrowers with no income to defer their monthly payments. In April, the CARES Act allowed federal student loan borrowers to defer their payments until September 30th.

""If you are one of 43 million Americans with a student debt, you can continue to defer your monthly payment after October 1 if you have no income,"" Alexander said in a statement.

Additionally, the GOP bill proposes changes to how the government calculates the amount families are expected to contribute towards education costs, known as the expected family contribution, or EFC. It also stipulates that funds received through the CARES Act, such as stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits, will not be counted when estimating a families' EFC.

The bill also ""simplifies the documentation of changes in family income for financial aid appeals,"" explains higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. ""It also adds a question to the FAFSA to ask whether the applicant and their family have been affected by the pandemic, but does not change the calculation of the EFC in response to an affirmative answer.""

But experts like Kantrowitz say the bill ultimately does not provide real relief for borrowers.

""The proposal for simplifying student loan repayment is just another income-driven repayment plan and does not provide student loan borrowers with any real relief. It's actually more expensive for borrowers than the pay-as-you-earn repayment plan,"" says Kantrowitz, referencing a popular repayment plan that borrowers currently can choose.

Bola Sokunbi, certified financial education instructor, founder of Clever Girl Finance and FAB AID board member, says many student loan borrowers may not be able to make their payments in October even if they still have income.

""While the student loan proposals might simplify repayment terms for borrowers who will be required to start making student loan repayments after the federal forbearance program ends in September, many borrowers will not be able to meet these requirements due to the financial impact of COVID-19,"" she explains. ""Despite still earning incomes, many have taken on the additional responsibility of supporting family members who have lost jobs or are otherwise impacted as a result of this health crisis.""

She continues, ""Many borrowers have also had incomes reduced and so even an income-based repayment plan might still be unaffordable for many given their added financial obligations. It's also important to consider that the majority of the student loan burden is carried by women, a demographic that has been more impacted than men as it relates to job losses and the inability to go back to work due to lack of childcare.""

And the new bill lacks the kind of student loan forgiveness that Democrats have proposed.

In May, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would eliminate the student debt of health-care workers treating patients with coronavirus.

""Frontline health workers are delivering care to the sickest patients and putting their own safety at great risk in order to keep doing their jobs,"" said Maloney in a statement. ""And in return, I believe that we have an obligation to ensure that they are relieved of the debt they incurred to train for this critical work – in graduate degree programs or other professional certification.""

That same month, Representative John Sarbanes (D-MD) introduced the ""What You Can Do For Your Country Act"" that would fine-tune the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which was created in 2007 to provide student debt forgiveness for public service workers but that the Government Accountability Office recently found currently denies forgiveness to 99% of applicants.

And on July 24th, Democratic Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Tim Kaine and Elizabeth Warren called for the next relief package to include student loan forgiveness for public servants who have worked on the frontline of the pandemic.

""This crisis has shined a bright light on the need for immediate action to ensure that we are giving our essential workers the support and forgiveness they have rightly earned,"" said the trio.

45,"Jul 28, 2020",Forbes,Senators Call For Student Loan Forgiveness Fix In Stimulus Package,"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and 17 other Democratic Senators are calling for a fix to the ... [+] public service loan forgiveness program to be included in the next stimulus. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) Getty Images

A group of Democratic senators are calling for a fix to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program to be included in the next Senate stimulus package. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, 18 Democratic senators are asking the Senate to include provisions from the What You Can Do For Your Country Act in the bill.

Led by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Tim Kaine, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris, the senators said this fix is critical because, “The COVID-19 pandemic has made the work of our nurses, health care providers, teachers, first responders and countless other public sector workers more important than ever before.” They said that essential workers need support and that they have earned student loan forgiveness.

The PSLF program is a complex one. It provides student loan forgiveness to those working in government or some non-profit organizations after 10 years of working full-time. In that time, borrowers must have the correct type of federal student loan, make all payments on-time, and be in the correct repayment plan. Due to the strict standards and other complexities, the program has been greatly criticized for having a 99% rejection rate.

The What You Can Do for Your Country Act was introduced in 2019 and makes several changes to the PSLF program and makes it easier to receive forgiveness. All federal loans and federal repayment plans would qualify under the legislation. It also takes steps to ensure the process is simplified and information about the program is clearer.

The bill would also allow borrowers to receive partial forgiveness after five years, rather than wait for ten. Some criticize the 10-year all-or-nothing requirement of the current PSLF program as it doesn’t reward shorter, though significant, lengths of public service. The bill summary says, “this allows borrowers to contribute a shorter, but still meaningful, period of public service and to ensure they can still receive a benefit from giving back.”

The What You Can Do for Your Country Act is endorsed by several organizations, including the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the National Education Association (NEA), and Young Invincibles. Former Vice President Joe Biden also included it in his presidential campaign policies.

But it’s unlikely Republicans will include these provisions in the stimulus bill. Many Republicans are critical of the program, particularly for its cost. President Trump has called for its elimination in each of his budget requests.

Adopting these provisions would only make it easier for more borrowers to receive forgiveness, therefore likely making it more expensive. (Some argue that more people would accept partial forgiveness at five years rather than full forgiveness at ten, making it cheaper.)

Senate Republicans have been opposed to student loan forgiveness generally, and especially in the stimulus bills. They ignored calls for debt forgiveness in the CARES Act and eliminated any student loan relief in the proposal they released yesterday.

This week, Senate Republicans outlined their priorities for the next stimulus bill. As expected, it included stimulus checks and money for education. What won’t be in the bill is more student loan relief or debt forgiveness.

While Senate Republicans haven’t released their bill language, they are expected to propose the same type of stimulus checks as in the CARES Act. However, Republicans want to end the student loan payment suspension granted in the same legislation.

There has been a debate among lawmakers and advocates about how to approach student loans going forward, but the debate has mostly been centered on how much relief to provide. Several proposals have been put forth to extend the student loan hiatus: some through December, others for another year.

Others went further. Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have been pushing for $10,000 in student debt forgiveness. Progressives in the House want $30,000 forgiven for each borrower.

Republicans have a different idea. Senator Lamar Alexander told reporters that the Republican bill will include his “new” income-driven repayment plan he released earlier this week, rather than extend the student loan repayment suspension.

Alexander’s plan is borrowers without an income would not be required to make any student loan payments. But this isn’t a new idea. His plan has different terms, but existing repayment plans already provide this protection for borrowers. And Alexander has proposed a version of this plan before.

Advocates have pushed back on the proposal, saying that it doesn’t provide enough relief. In fact, his proposal actually saves tax dollars. “Senator Alexander's proposal does little to nothing to alleviate the real strains people were already facing before the pandemic—particularly borrowers of color,’’ said Kyle Southern, Policy and Advocacy Director for Higher Education and Workforce at the advocacy organization, Young Invincibles.

“Rather than pursue this proposal, members of Congress should, at the very least, extend and expand the CARES Act automatic forbearance period while the country continues to navigate dual public health and economic crises,’’ Southern told Forbes. At the same time, Warren continues to call for student debt cancellation, in part for economic stimulus.

Alexander and others believe that suspending payments for all borrowers provides relief to borrowers who aren’t struggling. His plan would target those who are unemployed.

Even though suspending payments for all borrowers is overly inclusive, it can help stimulate the economy. If the borrowers who didn’t lose their job have extra cash freed up, they are able to spend more and help pump more money into the economy.

Millions of Americans are already unemployed and more might be soon as coronavirus cases continue to rise across the country. Alexander’s plan would take time to implement and would also put another burden on struggling Americans who would have to report to their loan servicers they are struggling.

47,"Jul 24, 2020",Forbes,Proposal: Cancel Student Loans Due To Coronavirus,"Getty getty

A new legislative proposal would cancel your student loan debt if you can show income loss due to Coronavirus.

Here’s what you need to know.

Student Loans

Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) want to cancel student loan debt for student loan borrowers who either lost income due to Covid-19 or if they have significant medical debt over the past three years. The senators’ bill, which is called the Medical Bankruptcy Fairness Act, would allow you to cancel your student loans in bankruptcy and provide relief to student loan borrowers who are struggling to make student loan payments. Unlike mortgages or credit card debt, it’s relatively difficult to cancel student loans in bankruptcy. However, borrowers have been in successful to cancel student loans in bankruptcy by demonstrating that their student loans cause an “undue hardship.” This new legislation, if passed in Congress, would help ease the path to cancel student loan debt.

Cancel student loan debt

This is not the first time that Democrats in Congress have proposed to cancel student loan debt. For example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) have been pushing for similar legislation for a good part of the last decade. For example, in 2009, 2014 and 2016, senators proposed similar legislation under the same bill name. The legislation has now been updated to include the possibility to cancel student loan debt due to income loss from Coronavirus. Warren, in particular, has been at the forefront to cancel student loan debt. During her presidential campaign, and in Congress, Warren proposed to cancel student loan debt for 95% of Americans. Student Debt Crisis, a leading student loan advocacy not-profit, recently sent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) a petition for student loan forgiveness with 1.2 million signatures.

There have been multiple proposals to cancel student loan debt from legislators and presidential candidates alike:

Other members of Congress have proposed legislation to forgive student loans, although none have become law.

Will student loans get cancelled?

There is bipartisan support to make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy, but there may not be consensus to act until after the election in the next Congress. Many student loan borrowers want to know whether there will be student loan forgiveness in the new stimulus package. Don’t expect student loan forgiveness to be included. Student loan forgiveness has not been the focus of the new stimulus package. Senate Republicans, who control the Senate, are expected to announce their new stimulus package Monday. Congress may extend student loan relief under the Cares Act, or Congress could allow the student loan relief to expire as planned on September 30, 2020. However, Congress is more focused currently on second stimulus checks, unemployment benefits, school openings and getting people back to work.

This story has been updated.

Negotiations between Senate Republicans and the White House continue today as GOP leaders try to craft a second stimulus bill. Currently, however, there are no indications that the proposal will include any additional relief for student loan borrowers.

Here’s where things stand:

Senate and White House negotiators have apparently agreed to shelve a proposed payroll tax cut.

Unemployment benefits may be extended “based on approximately 70% wage replacement,” according to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.

There may be a second round of stimulus checks, but the exact amount of those checks — as well as any applicable income restrictions — is still being hammered out.

According to the New York Times, a working proposal would include over $105 billion for education-related spending, most of which would be earmarked for K-12 schools, and much of that would be conditioned on schools reopening for physical, in-person instruction.

So far, no lead Republican negotiators in either the Senate or the White House have indicated that any student loan relief will be included in the stimulus package.

However, the situation remains very much in flux, and lawmakers are nowhere close to finalizing a package. According to the Washington Post, there is still no Republican consensus on several key elements of the stimulus proposal, and the release of a final package may be delayed until next week. Some Republican lawmakers have proposed breaking up the stimulus package into smaller components, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (whose members would have to approve any Senate-passed stimulus package) has already rejected that approach.

Outside of the stimulus negotiations, Republican lawmakers have only proposed two recent student loan initiatives:

Meanwhile, House Democrats recently passed legislation providing for $10,000 in private student loan forgiveness for every borrower. The Senate is highly unlikely to take up that measure or include it in their stimulus proposal, however.

49,"Jul 23, 2020",Chattanooga Times Free Press,Be wary of this student loan forgiveness scam,"Q: A friend told me there is now a legitimate program for student loan forgiveness, is this correct?

A: Great question that is getting lots of attention today. Navient has more than 10 million student loan clients and recently settled a student loan forgiveness lawsuit. The results of the settlement won't affect what individual borrowers owe. However, scammers were quick to notice this news item and are now targeting borrowers with false claims of debt forgiveness – for a fee. Here's what you need to know.

How the Scam Works

You receive a call from a person claiming to represent Navient. They explain that as a part of the lawsuit settlement, your student debt is partially or completely forgiven. Of course, you'll need to confirm your personal information and pay a fee to ""transfer"" the debt from Navient to ""the Department of Education"" or another official-sounding organization. These claims are based on actual procedures you may in fact qualify for, but this unsolicited caller is not working in an official capacity or related to any of the organizations cited in the call.

The caller explains the fees necessary, usually on a monthly basis, then request either debit or credit card information. Then, they will begin making withdrawals according to the payment plan you agreed to. Many consumers notice something is wrong when their Navient loan payment continues to be required, even after setting up payments with the new company.

Navient customers will not receive a phone call offering to transfer your loan. If you engage with these con artist callers, you could compromise your personal information and lose money as well. Instead, look for other options such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness, www.studentaid.gov and Department of Education, www2.ed.gov for deferral or other information in relation to your type of loan.

How to Avoid the Scam

Understand how the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program works. You can request information from your servicer, such as Navient, about potential student loan forgiveness programs, but it's important to know the basic requirements of the program – you must have Direct Loans and make 10-years of qualifying monthly payments under certain payment plans while employed by an eligible nonprofit or government organization. The government contracts with one specific servicer, FedLoans, www.myfedloan.org, to determine eligibility.

Don't take unsolicited callers at their word. Remember that legitimate businesses and government offices do not call people without their permission. If you receive a call out of the blue, don't be quick to give out your personal information, even if the caller offers you a great deal.

When in doubt, hang up. If you aren't sure about a caller and their claims, ask for a call back number, hang up, and do your research. A little digging will usually reveal if you were speaking with a legitimate company or not.

Visit official websites to learn about loan forgiveness. You can find out more about whether you qualify for loan forgiveness by visiting the Federal Student Aid website and Navient's official website at www.navient.com.

50,"Jul 23, 2020",Fox Business,"5 private student loan tips you should follow in 2020, according to an expert","Private student loans can help close the gap when paying for college if you've already maximized federal student loan eligibility. Knowing how to manage private student loans as a new or repeat borrower matters for staying on track with education debt. These expert tips can help you navigate private student loan repayment through 2020 and beyond.

1. Start paying off interest while still in school

Student loan servicers may allow a grace period while you're still enrolled in school, meaning you're not obligated to pay anything toward your loans. But it may be wise to at least make payments toward the interest.

""If a borrower has the financial flexibility to do so, it's always a good idea to start paying your student loans even while in college,"" said Kevin Walker, CEO of CollegeFinance.com.

To do that, you can contact your loan servicer and ask how to make payments while in school, Walker said. Even making small payments toward the interest can help reduce what you have to pay back later. If you're looking to lower your monthly payments to make paying off your student loans more manageable you may also want to consider a refinance (which we'll get to later). Use Credible to conduct more research on this topic to see if it's the right move for you.

THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO GET LOWER STUDENT LOAN RATES

2. Sign up for automatic payments

If you're already in student loan repayment mode, then putting payments on autopilot could be an easy way to save money.

""Nearly all private student loan lenders offer a borrower benefit of a rate reduction for automatic payments,"" Walker pointed out. This discount is typically 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent but over the life of your loans, that could add up to substantial savings.

Check your budget and cash flow to make sure automatic payments are feasible. You don't want to accidentally trigger an overdraft fee at your bank if an automatic payment is drafted that your balance can't cover.

8 OF THE BEST PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS IN 2020

3. Don't borrow more than you need

Only borrowing what you need to pay for school can keep you from ending up with more debt than you can manage.

Walker said the best way to approach this is to start with the number you think you need to pay for school, then take a closer look to see how you might be able to reduce it.

For example, he encouraged asking questions such as:

Can you travel less often or go to school closer to home?

Would renting textbooks be cheaper than buying them?

Is getting a roommate to reduce housing costs a realistic option?

If you're just starting college, can you leverage any AP credits earned in high school to accelerate your enrollment?

Are you able to get a part-time or full-time job to help with living expenses?

Are scholarships, grants or work-study options available to help pay for school?

Once you have an idea of what you need to borrow, consider what that works out to when it's time to begin student loan repayment. Running the numbers through a student loan calculator can help you get an accurate estimate of your payments.

Walker recommended considering what you expect to earn once you graduate. ""If the monthly payment seems like it'll be too high, say more than 10 to 12 percent of your income, then you probably need to revisit finding ways to lower your total cost of borrowing.""

THIS IS WHY STUDENT LOAN REFINANCING RATES ARE GOING DOWN

4. Consider refinancing when interest rates are low

Refinancing private student loans could save money on interest and streamline student loan repayment. Walker said that generally, the best time to refinance private student loans is any time you can lower your cost of borrowing but be sure to shop around.

For example, you may want to weigh the benefits of a fixed interest rate against a variable interest rate when comparing loan options. But it's important to consider where your credit score and credit history fit into the mix.

Lenders typically offer the lowest interest rates on private student loans to borrowers with a solid credit history. If you have a thin credit file or a lower credit score, it may be necessary to ask a co-signer to help you qualify for loans at the lowest rates.

If you're not comfortable asking someone to co-sign, Walker said the other option is to work on improving your score before attempting to refinance. When you're ready to refinance, consider using an online tool like Credible to make comparisons. You can get rate quotes from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score.

HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST STUDENT LOAN REFINANCING OFFER

5. Create a plan to pay off your debt

Private student loan debt can easily overwhelm you if you don't have a plan for paying it off. As you dive into student loan repayment, start by taking inventory of your loans.

""One simple thing all student loan borrowers should do - but often don't - is keep a list of the different loans they've taken on,"" Walker said.

Make a list of each loan you have and the monthly payment, as well as the due date. Next, compare the total payment for all of your loans to your budget to see if you can afford what you have to pay.

If your payments are higher than you'd like, consider refinancing if that could lower your rate and/or payment, Walker said. You can also look into interest rate discounts and any student loan forgiveness or repayment assistance your employer might offer as part of your benefits package.

Consider whether you could make extra payments toward the principal to get your loans paid off faster. And most importantly, stay in touch with your lenders.

If you're unable to pay because of financial hardship, they may be able to offer flexible repayment options, including deferment or forbearance programs. Head to Credible to learn more about private student loans and how to manage them.

51,"Jul 22, 2020",KTVH,MT SupCo reinstates suit accusing student-loan company of fraud,"HELENA — A Montana college graduate, who accused a national student-loan agency of bungling his opportunity to have his loans forgiven, can sue the firm in state court, the Montana Supreme Court has ruled.

The high court last week unanimously overturned a lower-court decision that said federal law pre-empted James Reavis’s ability to sue the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, which services millions of dollars in federal student loans nationwide.

Reavis, an attorney for the state Office of State Public Defender in Helena, sued PHEAA in August 2018, saying PHEAA made numerous accounting mistakes that could prevent him from using a federal program to forgive part of his student loans.

Now, he can pursue in state District Court his claims that PHEAA is violating Montana consumer protection laws.

Reavis, however, told MTN News Wednesday that the lawsuit still likely has a long ways to go, once it resumes in state court.

He said he brought the court action because PHEAA's company, FedLoan Servicing, kept reporting incorrectly how many payments he'd made on his student loans.

“I have tried for years, calling up their customer service hotline and trying to figure out, why don’t the numbers on this bill match the numbers of payments that I’ve actually been making,"" he said. ""I really just want to solve that issue so I can have some certainty on where my life is going to be, once my 10 years or 120 payments is up.”

Reavis said the amount of loans to be forgiven could be as much as $250,000.

PHEAA and FedLoan Servicing have come under fire for allegedly mismanaging the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is supposed to forgive portions of student loans for those who enter public-service jobs.

Last year, when the first wave of applicants became eligible for loan forgiveness, FedLoan denied 99 percent of the applications.

PHEAA, some of whose executives have close ties to President Trump and his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, signed a two-year extension in December of its 10-year, $1.3 billion contract with the federal government. It’s the biggest servicer of student loans in the country.

It’s also facing lawsuits from the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, who say its mismanagement has caused thousands of public servants to lose potential benefits.

The company has said the fault lies with Congress and the U.S. Department of Education, who dictate the rules and enforcement of those rules of the loan-forgiveness program.

Reavis graduated from the University of Montana law school in 2010 and also obtained a master’s in public administration in 2012. His suit said he consolidated his loans in 2012 so they could qualify for the loan-forgiveness program.

Under the program, graduates can qualify for loan forgiveness after making 120 monthly payments while working for a qualified employer.

Reavis began working for the Office of Public Defender, a qualifying employer, in 2012. His suit said he made his payments but that PHEAA “consistently failed to accurately account for his payments” and erroneously said that his payment schedule started on different dates for different loans.

His suit said PHEAA violated the Montana Consumer Protection Act by engaging in “deceit, negligent misrepresentation, or constructive fraud, and breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”

PHEAA said the lawsuit is pre-empted by federal law and that the case isn’t “ripe” for decision, because Reavis hasn’t yet applied for loan forgiveness. A state district judge in Helena agreed, dismissing the case.

But, on appeal, the Montana Supreme Court said pre-emption applies only if someone is disputing the disclosures that PHEAA must make to borrowers, and that Reavis is challenging actual actions by the agency, that may violate consumer laws.

“The crux of Reavis’ claims are that PHEAA failed to accurately account for the payments he made,” Justice Ingrid Gustafson wrote for the majority.","HELENA — A Montana college graduate, who accused a national student-loan agency of bungling his opportunity to have his loans forgiven, can sue the firm in state court, the Montana Supreme Court has ruled.
Now, he can pursue in state District Court his claims that PHEAA is violating Montana consumer protection laws.

52,"Jul 22, 2020",Forbes,Three Things To Know About Student Loan Forgiveness During The Pandemic,"Borrowers hoping to receive student loan forgiveness should know these three things right now. Getty

Student borrowers have been relieved of some stress and anxiety over their student loans during the pandemic. Congress passed the CARES Act and suspended payments and interest accrual on federally-held student loans through September 30, 2020 as part of lawmakers’ effort to provide Americans with economic relief.

For borrowers hoping to receive student loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program or through income-driven repayment (IDR), there are a few additional things they need to know.

Payment suspension counts toward some forgiveness.

The best news for student borrowers who want to receive loan forgiveness under PSLF or IDR is that the student loan suspension counts towards the required payments to receive loan forgiveness. As long as a borrower would have otherwise qualified for forgiveness, these months of non-payment will count. That means borrowers seeking PSLF must be employed in qualifying work. Unfortunately, those who lost their jobs will not be able to benefit in the same way. Those enrolled in income-driven repayment before will still be counted as making payments during this time.

Remember to re-certify employment for PSLF.

While it is not required, it is recommended that borrowers hoping to receive public service loan forgiveness certify their employment every year in order to stay on track. It’s easy for many to forget to complete this step, especially as a large number of Americans are working remotely and also have their payments suspended. But by remembering to do so, student borrowers can ensure they have all the needed documentation to receive forgiveness when the time comes to apply for forgiveness.

Remember to re-certify income for income-driven repayment.

Borrowers in income-driven repayment plans are required to annually re-certify their income to report any changes. This process adjusts payments according to borrowers’ fluctuations in income. Student borrowers may have received communications asking them to re-certify their income, and while payments may be suspended right now, it’s important they complete this process to ensure they will remain on course. If borrowers fail to re-certify, they risk being moved out of income-driven repayment which can hurt their progress towards both PSLF and IDR forgiveness. (Note: If borrowers have lost income, due to working fewer hours or pay cuts, they should contact their loan servicer to report these changes for when payments do restart.)

Student borrowers should keep an eye on what Congress does in the coming weeks. The student loan repayment suspension ends on September 30th and many are proposing extending that hiatus as part of the next stimulus package. Others are also calling for universal student loan forgiveness, though it is unclear if that will be included. Any bill that is passed could impact borrowers either by offering more relief, or by restarting payments in October.

54,"Jul 21, 2020",Forbes,Senator: No Student Loan Payments If You Have No Income,"Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) (Photo by Andrew Harnik - Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images

If you have no income, how would you like to stop making student loan payments?

Here’s what you need to know.

Student Loans

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) proposed on the Senate floor today a new proposal for your student loans that could result in zero student loan payments. Alexander, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, proposed to continue student loan relief for student loan borrowers. Alexander’s proposal would work like this:

No Income? No monthly payment. When you start earning income, your monthly student loan payment will be capped at 10% of your discretionary income. You get student loan forgiveness after 20 years (undergraduate student loans) or 25 years (for graduate school student loans) on the remaining balance. The months where you paid $0 will count toward the 20 or 25 years for student loan forgiveness. This proposal applies for existing and new student loan borrowers. Borrowers also have one other option: pay off student loans in 10 years. A 10-year student loan repayment plan would be like a mortgage, with equal principal and interest monthly payments until the student loan is repaid.

Alexander’s plan presumably applies to federal student loans only and would simplify the multitude of current federal student loan repayment plans, which can be confusing for student loan borrowers. Essentially, Alexander would replace the nine current student loan repayment plans with only two:

Income-Driven Repayment plan; or 10-year student loan repayment plan

Alexander says these ideas are not new, nor are they his ideas. He credits multiple student loan experts who have testified before the Senate Education Committee as well as senators such as Joe Manchin (D-WV), Rob Portman (R-OH) and Marco Rubio (R-FL), among others.

Simplify the FAFSA

Alexander also called for simplifying the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, from 108 questions to 20-33 questions. Alexander says a simpler FAFSA would provide more Pell Grants and help more low income Americans attend college. By simplifying the FAFSA and student loan repayment system, Alexander estimates the federal government could save $10 billion.

Student Loan Relief After September 30, 2020

Alexander’s proposal comes at a crossroads for student loan borrowers. Alexander notes that legislation called The Student Loan Repayment and FAFSA Simplification Act can end the confusion for student loan borrowers, simplify student loan repayment and help borrowers when current student loan relief from the Cares Act — the $2.2 trillion financial stimulus — which expires on September 30, 2020. Since March 13, 2020, the Cares Act provides several benefits for your student loans:

Congress paused all payments for federal student loans through September 30, 2020.

Congress also set interest rates at 0%, so interest will not accrue on your federal student loans during this period.

Congress halted collection of federal student loan debt during this period.

Congress allowed non-payment of federal student loan debt during this period to “count” toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness.

Alexander says new legislation could provide a solution after September 30, 2020. The Cares Act did not include any student loan forgiveness. Will you get student loan forgiveness? Alexander’s legislation does not include outright student loan forgiveness either, but would include student loan forgiveness similar to current income-driven repayment plans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) plans to introduce a new stimulus package this week. The stimulus package will include second stimulus checks and other economic priorities. However, student loans —particularly student loan forgiveness — are not expected to be a centerpiece of the new stimulus package.

What are the latest updates on your student loans?

Here’s what you need to know.

Student Loans

Let’s check in on the latest updates on your student loans so that you’re fully informed:

Will the Cares Act student loan relief be extended?

As of March 13, 2020, the Cares Act — the $2.2 trillion financial stimulus — provided several benefits for your student loans, including:

Congress paused all payments for federal student loans through September 30, 2020.

Congress also set interest rates at 0%, so interest will not accrue on your federal student loans during this period.

Congress halted collection of federal student loan debt during this period.

Congress allowed non-payment of federal student loan debt during this period to “count” toward the 120 required monthly payments for public service loan forgiveness.

However, the Cares Act did not include any student loan forgiveness. Will Congress extend these student loan benefits? There are three options for student loan relief that Congress may consider:

Don’t extend student loan debt relief. Extend student loan debt relief through October 31, 2020. Extend student loan debt relief through December 31, 2020.

If Congress extends these student loan benefits, it’s unlikely that they will be extended through 2021.

Student loan refinancing rates are at historic lows

Student loan refinancing rates have dropped to historic lows and start as low as 1.99%. Student loan refinancing is the process of combining your federal student loans, private student loans or both into a new, single student loan with a lower interest rate. The goal of student loan refinancing is to save money and pay off student loans faster. You can choose a variable or fixed interest rate, and you can also choose a loan term between 5 and 20 years to pay off your student loans.

This student loan refinancing calculator shows you how much you can save when you refinance student loans.

Student loan interest rates are at historic lows

It’s also much cheaper to borrow new student loans for college or graduate school. Rates for new student loans have dropped to an all-time low. New federal student loans for undergraduate students are 2.75% and new rates for graduate students are 4.30%. Private student loans may have even lower interest rates.

Joe Biden: Cancel student loan debt

Former Vice President Joe Biden released a comprehensive student loan plan, which includes student loan forgiveness and tuition-free college. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden proposed a Covid-19 student loan forgiveness plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower. Biden would forgive all undergraduate tuition from two- and four-year public colleges and universities. Biden also would forgive all undergraduate tuition for borrowers who earn $125,000 or less per year and who graduate from a private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU’s) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI’s). Through public service loan forgiveness, Biden also would forgive $10,000 a year in student loan debt for up to 5 years for a total of $50,000 of student loan forgiveness.

Will I get student loan forgiveness?

“Will I get student loan forgiveness?” is a popular question on the minds of many student loan borrowers. While Biden’s plans could become law, it’s important to focus on current proposals in Congress. There are several proposals in Congress to cancel student loan debt.

Student Debt Crisis, a leading non-profit focused on student loan debt, delivered a petition with 1.2 million signatures to former presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) — a leading proponent of student loan forgiveness — to cancel student loan debt in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Will the new stimulus package include student loan relief?

Given all these proposals, will the new stimulus package include student loan forgiveness? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to introduce a new stimulus package this week. Based on this key timeline for the new stimulus package, Congress could finalize the new stimulus package before August 7. Don’t expect student loan forgiveness in the new stimulus package, however. Why? Senate Republicans, who control the Senate with 53 seats, don’t support a plan to cancel to student loan debt. That doesn’t mean you won’t ever get student loan forgiveness—just don’t expect it now. There are still other ways that you can get student loan forgiveness. For example, you can receive student loan forgiveness through income-driven repayment plans as well as public service loan forgiveness. A new game changer for student loan forgiveness also makes it easier for those seeking public service loan forgiveness. Senate Republicans, who want to limit federal spending, also are focused on other economic priorities besides student loan forgiveness such as second stimulus checks.

Proposal: Cancel student loans in bankruptcy

Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D -PA) introduced new legislation last week that would make it easier for you to discharge student loans in bankruptcy if you are struggling financially and have been impacted by Covid-19. The COVID-19 Student 5 Loan Relief Act of 2020 would apply to both private student loans and federal student loans, and be available to all Americans impacted by Covid-19. That said, depending on your income level, you would have to show a loss of income anywhere from 20% - 40% to qualify under this student loan proposal.

This article has been updated to reflect that this legislation has passed the House as of July 21, 2020.

Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-PA) has introduced legislation to cancel private student loan debt in response to the Coronavirus pandemic and economic recession.

Introduced as an amendment to the latest reauthorization of the National Defense Authorization Act, Dean’s proposal would provide for $10,000 in private student loan forgiveness for every borrower.

“We can’t ignore private student loan borrowers that are suffering,” Dean said in a Tweet. “My amendment currently being debated on the floor would provide up to $10,000 in immediate relief to the roughly 4.5 million private student loan borrowers. This amendment is good for borrowers and our economy.” Private student loan borrowers were left out of the CARES Act’s student loan relief provisions.

Republicans blasted Dean’s proposal. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO) accused Democrats of trying to “socialize all student debt.”

Rep. Dean’s amendment is just the latest Democratic proposal to cancel student loan debt in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) recently called for $30,000 in across-the-board student debt cancellation to address the economic crisis and longtime racial injustices. “The average borrower has $30,000 worth of [student loan] debt — [cancelling that] will jump-start the economy,” she recently told Yahoo Finance. “Black student borrowers borrow, and default more than anyone else because of our inability to build generational wealth. I see that as a racial justice issue.”

Recently, over 100 civil rights and consumer advocacy organization called on Congress to cancel student loan debt on a broad scale. House and Senate Democrats have proposed $10,000 in across-the-board student loan forgiveness. And former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, recently reaffirmed his support for widespread student loan forgiveness, as well.

Update, July 21, 2020: The House has adopted Rep. Dean’s amendment.

57,"Jul 20, 2020",Money,What Happens to Your Student Loans If You Die?,"If you’re a college student, or the parent of a young adult, death is probably the last thing on your mind. But the continued spread of the coronavirus has brought the risk of death into focus for many Americans, leaving millions of relatively young people with one morbid question: What will happen to my student loans if I die?

“It seems to be the theme of the day,” said Betsy Mayotte, president and founder of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors (TISLA), as she recalled a recent conversation with a borrower that asked her what would happen to their debt if they were to contract the virus and die.

Over 44 million Americans have student loan debt, averaging $35,359, according to data by Experian. In a recent survey that targeted adults with student loans, more than 70% reported not knowing what will happen to their debt in the event of their death.

The answer to this question depends on several factors, including the type of loan you have, the date it was issued, and your lender. Here’s what to know.

Are federal student loans discharged if a borrower dies?

If you only have federal student loans, the answer is pretty simple. In the federal program, if a student dies, any loans that are in their name are discharged, Mayotte says.

The same rules apply to Parent PLUS loans. If the student for whom the loans were obtained, or the parent borrower dies, the loans must be discharged by the loan servicer.

But there is one recent development that helps federal borrowers even further: these discharges are now tax-free.

In the past, if a federal loan was discharged due to death, the student’s or the borrower’s estate would be responsible for paying taxes on the canceled amount. The IRS changed the rules in 2018, and the amount discharged after a death is no longer counted as taxable income.

To get a federal student loan discharged, a family member or a legal representative of the deceased must submit a request directly to the loan servicer and include an acceptable proof of death, such as the original or a certified copy of the death certificate.

A simple discharge in the case of death is one of many provisions available to help protect federal borrowers. That’s why most experts will tell you to limit your borrowing to these types of loans.

Are private student loans discharged if a student dies?

For private loans, things can get a little complicated, since there can be several outcomes depending on the year the loan was issued, whether there is a co-signer in place, and the rules established by the lender.

“The problem with private loans is that every single loan product is different,” says Mayotte. “Historically, for a lot of private loans, the borrower’s estate or their co-signer, if there was one, would often still be left on the hook.”

Thankfully, things have changed. In 2018, Congress updated the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) — the federal law that requires consumer disclosures from creditors and lenders, to say that if you die — lenders must release both the co-signer and your estate from any financial obligations related to student loan debt.

However, Adam Minsky, a Massachusetts-based attorney who specializes in student loan law, points out that this only applies to private loans that were originated after the amendment went into effect in 2018. “Older private loans are not subject to this requirement,” he says.

This means that if you took out a private student loan in 2015, and have a co-signer, that person could still be liable for that debt if you die. Minsky also says that depending on the state’s law, it may be possible for a student loan creditor to go after the deceased borrower’s estate if the loan was issued prior to the amendment.

Besides that, if you’re married, and live in a community property state, such as Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, or Wisconsin, your spouse could also be liable for that debt if you die, even if they didn’t co-sign the loan, as long as it was taken after the marriage.

Like with federal loans, you won’t have to pay taxes on any amount discharged by the lender, regardless of the year the loan was issued — at least for now. According to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president of research at Savingforcollege.com, the tax-free status was added in the tax law passed in 2017, and it will be in effect until 2025.

If you want to know exactly what will happen to your private loans, your best bet is taking a look at your contract to see if there’s anything specified — if there aren’t any details, don’t fret. Most private lenders offer what’s known as a “compassionate review,” in which any survivors can request a death discharge. There is no guarantee that this will work, but it’s still an option to explore, as each lender evaluates these on a case-by-case basis.

Commentary from finder.com's Certified Commercial Loan Officer, Anna Serio:

What happens to co-signers on private loans

According to finder.com's Certified Commercial Loan Officer, Anna Serio Generally, cosigners are still responsible for repaying private student loans, even if the primary borrower dies. While it’s now rate, it used to be common for private student loans used to go into automatic default when the borrower died. This meant that the cosigner was required to pay off the balance in full.

That’s no longer common practice, but different lenders have different policies to handle the death of a borrower. That’s why it’s important to reach out to the servicer of any loan you cosigned as soon as possible.

What happens to parents on parent loans

The federal government discharges Parent PLUS Loans completely if the parent or student dies. And thanks to a 2018 change in the US tax code, the surviving party isn’t responsible for paying federal taxes on the forgiven portion. State taxes may still apply, however, so you still may need to pay a little extra that year.

What can you do?

Each private lender has their own way of dealing with student loan discharge, but you can still prepare yourself and safeguard those around you from carrying your financial burden by doing the following:

Check out the terms: The first thing you can do is look at your promissory note, since this will give you a better idea of how the lender deals with these cases. The promissory note is the contract that contains all of the details of the loan which you agreed to, including the total amount, interest rate, and repayment terms.

“Check the note, and see what it says about what would happen should the student pass away,” says Mayotte. If this isn’t stipulated, or if you can’t find your promissory note, you can always contact the lender to obtain this information directly.

Consider a life insurance policy: If you have private student loans that were issued before 2018, then life insurance is something you could look into. Life insurance policies, particularly term policies, cost next to nothing, especially for a young individual who is relatively healthy.

David Gastwirth, a senior insurance strategist at American Business, a life insurance brokerage firm, says that life insurance can serve as a safety net when taking out student loans to protect the borrower’s estate, co-signer, or spouse in case the student dies while the loan is still outstanding.

According to Gastwirth, a 10-year term policy worth $250,000 for a 20 year-old woman who’s in fair health, costs around $125 a year — or less than $11 a month.

When taking out a life insurance policy, make sure to take into account the entire cost of the loan, including any interest accrued while you’re in school and other fees. “It's always better to have a bit more than a bit less,” says Gastwirth.

If you’re unsure where to start, you can always contact a life insurance broker, or check out an online marketplace, such as Health IQ, to explore your options.

59,"Jul 16, 2020",NBC News,Betsy Devos' refusal to honor student loan forgiveness shows her disrespect for the law,"Even in a government full of people without the integrity, will or courage to do the right thing, most of the agencies stand down — or at least pretend to — when ordered by the courts. But not the Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos, who seems to have been only further animated by her losses in court over her efforts to deny the rightful debt cancellations owed to people who attended predatory, for-profit colleges, borrowers who are disproportionately women and people of color, and often now working in front-line jobs.

First, DeVos tried to delay an Obama-era update to Borrower Defense to Repayment rules — a 1990s-era regulation that says that, if a school violates state law, borrowers are entitled to cancellation of their federal student loans. The Obama administration’s update included new protections like forbidding schools from preventing students from suing in class-action lawsuits. A judge found DeVos’ delay to this rule “unlawful” and “arbitrary and capricious.”

She has also failed to cancel the debts of tens of thousands of borrowers the government already deemed entitled to relief. Another lawsuit challenged this failure, and the court ordered DeVos to halt debt collection for any borrowers covered by the lawsuit; 16,000 students and parents were collected from anyway. So DeVos was held in contempt of court and the department was fined $100,000.

In a stunning display of their ongoing lawlessness, the department then found yet another 17,258 borrowers it had illegally collected on after the ruling.

DeVos’ legal troubles didn’t stop there. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey had previously applied to the department on behalf of 7,200 former students of Corinthian Colleges in the state, saying their debts were unlawful and therefore uncollectable. In 2018, a court found DeVos had illegally seized the tax refund of two Massachusetts borrowers, given that they had open applications for debt cancellation. But DeVos kept on illegally seizing other Massachusetts borrowers' tax refunds even after this ruling, leading to yet another lawsuit.

This June, the same judge who found DeVos’ actions illegal in 2018 ordered her to cancel the debts of all 7,200 former Corinthian Colleges students in Massachusetts.

A string of legal defeats like this might give a department head pause. Instead, it’s been full speed ahead for DeVos.

She rewrote the Borrower Defense regulations so dramatically that almost no borrower will ever qualify for debt cancellation again; the department itself estimated that only about 3 cents of every dollar borrowed will be forgiven under the DeVos rule. Her rewrite was so drastic that 10 Republican senators joined the Democrats to vote to overturn her rewrite this March and Trump’s veto kept DeVos’ rewrite in place.

And now, the department is trying a particularly cruel and Orwellian sleight of hand — denying debt cancellations without admitting they are doing so. They are writing to tens of thousands of defrauded borrowers that their claims have been approved, but because there’s no evidence they were harmed, the amount of debt relief is zero dollars.

But perhaps that’s to be expected: DeVos, of course, had stacked her department with former executives of for-profit colleges, like Robert Eitel and Diane Auer Jones, both formerly of the for-profit college chain Career Education Corp.

And, when she was once forced to process debt cancellations previously approved by the Obama administration, she took the time to write a comment at the bottom of the form, noting she was approving the cancellations “with extreme displeasure.”

The department’s refusal to comply with the rule of law has pushed the courts toward bigger, broader, more punitive rulings than courts usually enter against federal agencies.Her obstinance is wasting government resources in service of denying discharges to Black and Latinx borrowers hit hard by the last crisis — and now harder by the pandemic.

As a result of the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, Black wealth fell by more than half, and Latinx wealth fell by 66 percent. These communities were then targeted a second time, as for-profit colleges swooped into this devastation, holding out false promises and falsifying job placement statistics to entice people in hard-hit communities to enroll in their schools. Fraud was endemic at these institutions (as evidenced by the cascade of lawsuits and investigations they have faced), which is part of the reason that for-profit college graduates typically make less after graduating than they did before. These are the same scammed students DeVos has claimed were simply looking for “free money.”

But the targeting had worked: Black women made up 26 percent of enrollees at the for-profit giant Corinthian prior to its collapse into bankruptcy. In Massachusetts, at two Corinthian Schools, 80 percent of students were women and 75 percent were Black or Latinx.

So during the Obama Administration, thousands of former students of for-profit colleges organized with a group called The Debt Collective and sought their right to debt cancellation under those 90s-era Borrower Defense rules. Borrowers pointed to lawsuits and investigations — such as the Department of Education’s own enforcement actions against the for-profit giant Corinthian, which collapsed into bankruptcy in 2015 following evidence of widespread wrongdoing — as proof that they, and by virtue of that fact, the government had been defrauded.

The Obama administration, however, rejected calls by borrowers and advocates alike to cancel these debts in bulk; one borrower, Pamela Hunt, even recorded a video message to President Barack Obama, asking him to cancel borrowers’ debts en masse before leaving office. But they instead put in place a process to decide, claim by claim, who would receive debt cancellation. This left the many borrowers with undecided claims uniquely vulnerable to a DeVos-led department that has been aggressively defiant of both borrower’s rights and of the courts.

The consequence now is that too many students who were defrauded by for-profit schools that are totally dependent on federal dollars are still suffering with unfair and unmanageable debts, and relying on a Cabinet member who doesn’t think the law applies to her.

60,"Jul 16, 2020",CNBC,How to avoid getting crushed with student loan debt during the pandemic,"While universities and colleges struggle to decide if they should reopen for a fall semester amid the coronavirus pandemic, many Americans are questioning the value of a college degree. College is more expensive than ever. Yet many campuses may remain closed, forcing millions of students to take classes online. A 2020 high school graduate could face $37,200 in loans upon completing a four-year degree, according to a new NerdWallet analysis of data from the National Center for Education Statistics. It's no wonder close to 44 million Americans are collectively plagued by $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. The situation has become more tenuous since the onset of the pandemic, with millions of Americans unemployed, unable to repay their mounting debts. Luckily, the federal government has offered some assistance under the CARES Act. Federal student loans offered by the U.S. Department of Education have been placed in forbearance until Sept. 30, yet political gridlock makes it uncertain if this will be extended. However, people with private student loans still have to pay back their loans. Tara Falcone, a certified financial planner and founder of ReisUP, offers tips on how to manage the financial burden.

1. Pay private student loans first

This is important, since ""[lenders] are still collecting, so definitely make these loan payments if you can afford to,"" Falcone says. Failure to do so will adversely affect your credit score and hurt you in the long run. ""You don't want a scare the next time you check your credit report,"" she warns.

2. Refinance if you can

With interest rates near record lows, now is also a good time to refinance your private loans. However, not everyone will be able to refinance. People with good credit scores, 700 and above, and have a steady income are the likeliest to be approved.

3. Get ahead of the curve with your federal loans

With federal loans in forbearance, Falcone advises that people still try to make payments if they can. ""If your situation has not changed too much in recent months, continue to pay down your federal loans. Your contributions will go straight to the principal and end up saving on interest.""

If you are struggling to keep up with payments, Falcone advises that people start slashing expenses where they can. ""You don't want to default, because it will hurt your credit score, Try to protect it by getting rid of unnecessary expenses.""

4. Look for loan forgiveness programs

Financial planning for the future

For millennials saddled with college debt who are starting families, long-term financial planning is key. Despite their challenges, they have to find a way to save for their children's future. The last thing they want is the next generation to have the same financial burden they have. No one knows if college will be more expensive in 20 years, especially now that higher education may be changed forever. Parents hoping to ease the burden on their children have a few options, but they first need to decide how much they want to fund, says Falcone. ""Will it be half of tuition and the other half the student pays for? Will it be all of school? Parents need to decide and set a savings goal.""

There’s another student loan forgiveness lawsuit.

Here’s what you need to know - and how it may affect you.

Student Loans

Attorneys general from 22 states, plus the District of Columbia, sued U.S. Secretary of Education in federal court in San Francisco Wednesday over her decision to limit student loan forgiveness for students. The coalition, led by attorneys general in Massachusetts and California, allege that DeVos’ policy violates federal law, and they are asking the court to replace it with student loan forgiveness rules from the Obama administration.

Student loan forgiveness: what it means for you

The student loan forgiveness rules are known as borrower defense to repayment, which allow students to have their federal student loans forgiven if a school employed illegal or deceptive practices to encourage the students to borrow debt to attend the school. However, under the new student loan forgiveness rules, students could have to repay federal student loans even if they didn’t find gainful employment or finish their degree before their school closed. Opponents, including several veterans groups, claim the new student loan forgiveness rules unfairly hurts veterans who have been defrauded by for-profit colleges and who should receive student loan forgiveness. Critics also argue that the new rules will limit the amount of student loan forgiveness that borrowers will receive, even if they are victims of fraud.

“If only college students in America could count on the U.S. Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, to fight for them as she has consistently done for the predatory for-profit education industry that has deceived and cheated these very students,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said. “Under her leadership, the U.S. Department of Education has replaced critical borrower protections with a process that makes it virtually impossible for victimized students to get the relief they should qualify for.”

The 23 attorneys general, all of whom are Democrats, represent Massachusetts, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Trump vetoes student loan forgiveness bill

The U.S. House of Representatives tried to overturn DeVos’ student loan forgiveness rule, by a vote of 231-180. However, President Donald Trump vetoed the legislation and the House failed to override the veto. In March, the U.S. Senate voted on a bipartisan basis, 53-42, to overturn the student loan forgiveness rule too. However, Trump’s veto doesn’t impact public service loan forgiveness or student loan forgiveness through income-driven repayment.

DeVos wants to balance the needs of students and taxpayers

The Education Department has not commented publicly on the lawsuit. However, DeVos has made her position clear regarding the borrower defense rule and student loan forgiveness. DeVos rewrote the rules —which were drafted during the Obama administration — to narrow the requirements to receive student loan forgiveness. Why? DeVos wants to strike a balance between the needs of students and taxpayers. DeVos believes that too many borrowers could qualify for student loan forgiveness under the Obama-era rules, which potentially could cost taxpayers billions of dollars. DeVos says her student loan forgiveness rules would save taxpayers $11 billion over 10 years. That said, DeVos doesn’t want to stop student loan forgiveness through borrower defense to repayment. Rather, DeVos believes that student loan forgiveness should not be automatic. DeVos said borrowers impacted by school closure would need to apply for student loan forgiveness and prove financial harm. Borrowers also would have three years to prove their claim for student loan forgiveness.

Will there be student loan forgiveness in new stimulus package?

The new stimulus package may be introduced next week. Will you get student loan forgiveness? There are several proposals to cancel student loan debt. The latest proposal, which is included in the Heroes Act financial stimulus, is to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for borrowers who are “struggling financially.” However, the Senate will not pass the Heroes Act in its current form. Former Vice President Joe Biden supports $10,000 of student loan forgiveness for all student loan borrowers, and do several U.S. senators. However, the new stimulus bill likely won’t include student loan forgiveness. Senate Republicans, who control the Senate, don’t support a plan to cancel to student loan debt. That said, Student Debt Crisis, a leading student loan advocacy non-profit, has amassed 1.2 million signatures to cancel student loan debt, and sent the petition to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to help build momentum for student loan forgiveness. Even if student loan forgiveness is not included in the new stimulus, you can still get student loan forgiveness through income-driven repayment plans and public service loan forgiveness.

Can you discharge your student loans in bankruptcy? A new proposal says yes, but not everyone qualifies.

Here’s what you need to know.

Student Loans

Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D -PA) introduced new legislation today that would make it easier for you to discharge student loans in bankruptcy if you are struggling financially and have been impacted by Covid-19. Here’s the good news: the COVID-19 Student 5 Loan Relief Act of 2020 would apply to both private student loans and federal student loans, and be available to all Americans impacted by Covid-19.

Discharge student loans: the fine print

Now, here’s the fine print: you may not qualify to discharge your student loans in bankruptcy under this proposal. According to the bill, to qualify:

your income has been reduced due to the Covid-19 pandemic; or the primary income earner in your family died; or you have become permanently disabled

Now, lets’ break down the first requirement based on the language on the bill. The legislation requires a reduction in income due to Covid-19. What does this mean? Here’s what the bill says. It’s not enough that your income simply declined. Specifically, to qualify to discharge your student loans in bankruptcy

If you make less than this pre-tax income...your income must decline by at least this percentage...

< $75,000 Income: at least 20% decline $75,000 - $125,000 Income: at least 30% decline $125,000+ Income: at least 40% decline

Plus, the relevant time period is “beginning January 21, 2020 and extending until 60 days after the duration of the Covid-19 emergency or the duration of the Covid-19 outbreak or as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.” Even if you wouldn’t qualify under this specific proposal, you still may be able to discharge your student loans in bankruptcy through the normal course based on your financial situation. Traditionally, unlike mortgages or credit card debt, student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. There are exceptions, however, namely if certain conditions regarding financial hardship are met.

Cancel student loan debt

This latest bankruptcy legislation is part of an ongoing effort to provide more student loan relief, particularly as as result of Covid-19. For example, Student Debt Crisis, a leading student loan advocacy not-profit, recently sent Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) a petition for student loan forgiveness with 1.2 million signatures. Warren, who proposed student loan forgiveness for 95% of Americans, has been a proponent of student loan forgiveness and student loan debt cancellation. Scanlon’s legislation would make it easier by amending Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, although the requirements to qualify may be challenging for some. Student loan forgiveness has been a hot topic in Congress, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, former Vice President Joe Biden reiterated his support for student loan forgiveness and his support to discharge student loans in bankruptcy. Other members of Congress have proposed legislation to forgive student loans, although none have become law.

Will student loans be included in the new stimulus?

Maybe. It’s unlikely that this bill or a similar bill to discharge student loans in bankruptcy will be included in the new stimulus. The new stimulus package may be introduced next week. Currently, the focus includes second stimulus checks, state and local aid, unemployment benefits or a return-to-work bonus and liability protection due to Covid-19 for businesses. However, don’t expect student loan forgiveness to be included. However, Congress may extend student loan relief under the Cares Act, or Congress could allow the student loan relief to expire as planned on September 30, 2020. That said, student loans have not been the focus among Republicans (who control the Senate) among other high priority issues. There is bipartisan support to make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy, but there may not be consensus to act until after the election in the next Congress.

63,"Jul 15, 2020",Second Wave Media,Ypsi startup flourishes during pandemic by helping clients pursue student loan forgiveness,"This story is part of a series in Concentrate about Washtenaw County businesses' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Support for this series is provided by Ann Arbor SPARK.

When Catalina Kaiyoorawongs contracted COVID-19 in March, a cloud of uncertainty descended on her world.

More than just her health was in jeopardy. The future of LoanSense, the Ypsilanti-based tech startup she had co-founded and poured her heart into, was also suddenly threatened. LoanSense is a digital student loan advisor, based at Ann Arbor SPARK's SPARK East business incubator, that simplifies the loan repayment process through customized plans emphasizing loan forgiveness.

Pre-COVID, the company focused on working with employers to offer employees student loan assistance as a benefit. After successful fundraising in January, Kaiyoorawongs and her co-founder Ivan Herndon were just about to start a pilot phase when the pandemic delivered a shocking turn of events.

""Pretty much, we woke up in March and a number of partners had pushed back [or] cancelled their launches,"" Kaiyoorawongs says. ""Ivan had just left his full-time job at StockX for all of the launches that were now not happening. We didn't know what we were going to do.""

It didn't take long for them to resolve not to let the virus stop them. In fact, they actually landed on a better go-to-market strategy that has allowed LoanSense to expand and flourish.

""We said, 'We are going to listen to the market and adapt with what the market needs us to do,'"" Kaiyoorawongs says. ""We came out of March with a vengeance. From April to May we served hundreds of users.""

The surge in business was the result of a pivot to working directly with individual consumers rather than collaborating with employers, which Kaiyoorawongs says is a harder sell when companies are preoccupied with more pressing pandemic-related details.

The move is especially timely given that many people need help to understand the student loan provisions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Kaiyoorawongs has begun discussing how people can take advantage of the CARES Act in a new webinar series. Attendance at most of the weekly free webinars has been at maximum capacity.

""What COVID has done is created zero-dollar payments on student loans,"" she says. ""But what people don't understand is that if they don't file into the right plan, those payments just get pushed to the end of 10 years.""

Stressing the importance of education, Kaiyoorawongs adds that webinar participants also learn about student loan strategies, how to understand their loan files, and the key aspects of loan literacy. Participants who decide not to manage their own loans can choose to pay LoanSense experts to help them.

Getting started takes mere minutes. After a sign-in that takes about 30 seconds, users answer five questions and upload their loan information. The app then recommends the best path to student loan repayment or forgiveness.

""We have basically streamlined an entire federal process. It couldn't be easier,"" Kaiyoorawongs says.

Once a person is on board, a LoanSense expert can liaise their paperwork from start to finish. Over the last year, the company has researched and cataloged all the errors that people commit when filling out their paperwork themselves. This data and expert knowledge of the biggest pitfalls has resulted in LoanSense helping clients save thousands of dollars.

Just a week ago Kaiyoorawongs personally helped a doctor get back $117,000 of extra payments he made prior to the announcement of the CARES Act.

""Before COVID he decided to pay back his loans as quickly as possible,"" she says. ""Suddenly he could get six months of zero-dollar payments counted toward forgiveness. And the [federal Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act] might extend that for another year.""

When the client discussed this with Kaiyoorawongs, she advised that he call his loan servicer and ask that the money be returned to him. His own initial efforts proved futile. So Kaiyoorawongs got on a call with him and asked the person managing his case to look up the law.

""They put us on hold for about 10 minutes and then came back and told us we were correct and he was entitled to get his money back,"" she says.

Having experienced how impactful LoanSense was to his own financial situation, the client decided to invest $10,000 into the startup, which is actively seeking investors. Kaiyoorawongs has nothing but high hopes for the company's future. The LoanSense team has been busy working on online channel partnerships that will be rolled out by August or September.

She stresses that as LoanSense continues to grow, its goal will be unchanging.

""No matter what we do, we will always be committed to helping people make the best student loan decisions for themselves,"" she says.

The attorneys general of 22 states and the District of Columbia have filed suit against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over her new “borrower defense” rule. The rule provides for student loan forgiveness for defrauded students.

Led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, the lawsuit asks the courts to knock down the 2019 Trump administration rule and reinstate the former 2016 regulation.

The borrower defense rule allows the Secretary of Education to discharge student debt when students were defrauded by their colleges. In 2016, the Obama administration wrote a new regulation outlining how student borrowers could get loan forgiveness after claims of fraud increased because of the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech.

When DeVos came into office in 2017, she delayed the Obama administration’s 2016 rule. DeVos then rewrote the regulation and created an incredibly high standard for a burden of proof for student borrowers. Under the Obama rule, a student just needed to show a substantial misrepresentation by the school to receive relief.

The DeVos borrower defense rule makes that stricter. It defines misrepresentation as, “a statement, act, or omission by an eligible school to a borrower that is false, misleading, or deceptive; that was made with knowledge of its false, misleading, or deceptive nature or with a reckless disregard for the truth; and that directly and clearly relates to enrollment or continuing enrollment at the institution or the provision of educational services for which the loan was made.”

Those are very high standards for students to meet, making debt forgiveness unlikely for many students. According to the lawsuit, that standard is at odd with the Department’s position that misrepresentation doesn’t require proving that.

DeVos’ rule also requires students to provide evidence of financial harm. The attorneys general said that requirement is “arbitrary and onerous.” They also say the evidence requirement is unachievable and that the rule should be reversed because it is “arbitrary and capricious.”

This spring, Congress voted to overturn the rule on a bipartisan basis, but President Trump vetoed the bill. The House voted to override his veto, but could not reach the required two-thirds majority threshold. Because the override failed the rule went into effect on July 1.

65,"Jul 15, 2020",Forbes,Over 100 Civil Rights Groups Tell Congress: Cancel Student Debt In Next Stimulus Bill,"Getty

A coalition of 103 civil rights groups, consumer rights organizations, and think tanks have sent a joint letter to Congressional leadership in the House and Senate, calling on them to include widespread student loan forgiveness for all borrowers in the next economic stimulus package.

With 44 million Americans struggling with unprecedented levels of student loan debt, massive unemployment, and a pandemic that shows no signs of ending, broad student loan forgiveness has been gaining traction as a means of economic stimulus and relief.

While the CARES Act suspended payments, interest, and collections on government-held federal student loans, the implementation of these protections have been uneven at best. And consumer advocates have argued that the CARES Act falls far short of what borrowers actually need. “Student debt cancellation offers a much more effective solution than short-term payment suspension,” the organizations argued in the letter.

The House recently passed the HEROES Act, which would extend the CARES Act’s student loan relief provisions for another year, and would also provide $10,000 in student debt cancellation, but only for the most economically distressed borrowers. The organizations wrote in their letter that this is not enough. “This limitation excludes 25 million Americans — more than half of all borrowers. It would exclude those in economic distress as a result of the coronavirus crisis, such as those laid off due to the pandemic,” the organizations wrote. “We call on you to fight for student debt cancellation that helps all borrowers. Removing limitations based on economic distress would not only avoid unfair cutoffs but also ease administration.”

The organizations further noted the racial disparities in the student debt system. Studies have shown that student loan debt disproportionately impacts communities of color, and Black people in particular. Federal data released in 2017 showed that nearly half of Black student loan borrowers who entered college in the 2003-04 academic year had defaulted on at least one student loan 12 years later. This same data shows that Black students who enrolled in school in 2004 owed more on their student loans after 12 years than the amount originally borrowed.

“Black and brown communities have been hit hardest by the devastating health and economic consequences of this crisis, just as they were most impacted by the Great Recession a decade ago,” the coalition wrote. “At the same time, student debt disproportionately impacts Black and brown borrowers.”

“As the economy reels, jobs remain hard to come by, and people are faced with extraordinary hardships the federal government could provide immediate relief and enable a more widespread and equitable recovery by cancelling student debt,” said Alexis Goldstein, Senior Policy Analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, one of the organizations that signed on to the letter. “Cancelling student debt is an incredibly powerful tool Congress has to reduce inequality and provide dramatic relief to communities of color hit hardest by the pandemic”

“Even without experiencing a major public health crisis, or a recession, student debt exacerbates existing systemic inequities and racial disparities,” said Ashley Harrington, Federal Advocacy Director at the Center for Responsible Lending, another organization that signed on to the letter. “This is why substantial relief for the more than 44 million student borrowers already in repayment is so desperately needed. Moving forward, any legislation enacted during the pandemic must include broad universal debt cancellation for all borrowers, including private and federal student loan holders... Student debt relief is minuscule compared to the relief used to bail out big companies during the financial crisis.”

Broad student loan forgiveness is more realistic now from a policy standpoint than at any time before, but it remains a long shot in the Republican-controlled Senate. Senate GOP leaders immediately declined to even consider the HEROES Act when passed by the Democratic-led House. And Republican Senate leaders have recently expressed concerns about additional spending related to a second major stimulus bill, which could place limitations on any further student loan relief.

Major organizations that signed onto the letter calling for the cancellation of student debt include the American Federation of Teachers, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, Consumer Reports, Greenpeace, Habitat for Humanity, the NAACP, the National Women's Law Center, and the National Young Farmers Coalition.

CHICAGO — A new program will wipe out existing student loan debt for former City Colleges of Chicago students who re-enroll and earn their degree or certificate, officials announced Tuesday.

As part of the new “Fresh Start” program, any former City Colleges of Chicago students who left in good academic standing but did not earn their degree or certificate can re-enroll and have their debts forgiven if they complete the program.

“Too often student debt stands in the way of people’s lives and futures,” City Colleges of Chicago Chancellor Juan Salgado said. “This is no time to stop, no time to take a gap year, especially for students from our local communities.”

According to Salgado, as many as 21,000 former students who owe a combined $17 million in debt qualify for the program. Of those students, 51 percent are Black and 34 percent are Latino, many coming from neighborhoods most impacted by the economic effects of coronavirus and systemic racism.

Mayor Lori Lighfoot said the program is part of a larger effort to address poverty and improve upward mobility in the city.

“This is about furthering our citywide commitment to educating Chicagoans, no matter their age or circumstances when they left the City Colleges of Chicago system,” Lightfoot said.

Salgado said earning a degree could provide many with improved prospects in the current economy, pointing to a decline in the number of jobs which don’t require a degree but increasing opportunities for those who have one.

“With debt they cant register for courses, they can’t complete their certificate or degree, and most likely wont be part… of the recovery,” Salgado said.

The “Fresh Start” program will be a limited-time opportunity; students have about a month to enroll. Those who do will have half of their outstanding debt forgiven when they re-enroll, and the remaining half forgiven when they complete their studies.

“These students have had success with us before, they’ve acquired some credit and left with good academic standing, and now they can finish what they started,” Salgado said.","CHICAGO — A new program will wipe out existing student loan debt for former City Colleges of Chicago students who re-enroll and earn their degree or certificate, officials announced Tuesday.

67,"Jul 12, 2020",Wall Street Journal,Another Loan Forgiveness Scheme,"Forgiving most of the $1.5 trillion in federal student loans is already mainstream Democratic Party policy. And now progressives are seeking to cancel bank loans sold to third parties such as debt collectors. Look out below.

Most states have usury laws that cap interest rates. But Congress can regulate interstate commerce to pre-empt state usury laws on loans issued by nationally and state chartered banks. This helps banks lend to consumers across the country and gives Americans more credit options.

California’s usury laws thus don’t apply to loans by banks headquartered in other states but do cover loans by non-banks such as payday lenders and fintech companies. Yet several class-action lawsuits have been filed in federal courts arguing that state usury laws should apply to loans made by banks that are later sold or transferred to third parties. Ergo, borrowers should no longer have to repay loans that change hands if they carry an interest rate that exceeds their state’s usury laws.

The Supreme Court for 200 years has held that loan agreements are “valid when made.” And the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2000 that debt owed on credit cards issued by a national bank was exempt from usury laws of a borrower’s state even though the bank had sold the receivables to a department store.

But the Second Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. In Madden (2015), a New York borrower who defaulted on credit-card payments sued a debt collector that had bought the receivable. Citing guidance by the Obama Comptroller of the Currency in 2014, the Second Circuit held that “third-party debt buyers are distinct from agents or subsidiaries of a national bank” and thus bound by state usury laws.

The Supreme Court decided not to hear Madden on appeal. But even the Obama Solicitor General declared in a brief that the Second Circuit misinterpreted federal law. The Second Circuit, the Obama SG wrote, failed “to understand how application of state usury laws . . . would impair the bank’s exercise of [its] powers.” Well, yes.

If delinquent borrowers can claim state usury laws let them renege on the debt, banks will either have to reduce lending to high-risk borrowers or sell loans at steep discounts to third parties. This is what happened after Madden in Connecticut and New York where the Second Circuit decision applies.

A 2017 study by Stanford, Columbia and Fordham law school professors observed that “Madden reduced the flow of credit, especially to higher-risk borrowers whom lenders normally charge above-usury rates. Lenders made relatively fewer loans to higher-risk borrowers in the affected states, and the loans they did make were smaller.”

After Madden, loan volumes declined by 52% for borrowers with FICO scores below 625 in New York and Connecticut while increasing 124% for similar borrowers in other states. The study also found that “the price of notes backed by above-usury loans issued to borrowers in affected states declined, particularly when those borrowers were late on their payments.”

Defaults are expected to climb amid the pandemic, which could rattle credit markets and cause banks to restrict lending. The damage will be compounded if more borrowers file Madden copy-cat lawsuits. The good news is that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Comptroller recently issued regulations reaffirming that loans are valid as made even if transferred to third parties.

But watch out. Elizabeth Warren and five other Democratic Senators say “the valid when made doctrine is a legal fiction” and the new banking regulations will enable “predatory lending principles.” These are the folks who could soon be running our economy.","Most states have usury laws that cap interest rates.

68,"Jul 10, 2020",Lifehacker,See if You Qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness With This Tool,"As the election approaches, student loan forgiveness has become a popular topic. While some politicians have proposed student loan forgiveness, the current Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program has had some difficulties.

Recently, the Department of Education released new data for its PSLF program—and the numbers still look grim. According to the latest report, only 2.37% of applicants have been eligible for PSLF. Since 2018, the program has been under fire for high rejection rates.



One of the reasons for the rejections is the program’s strict criteria. Borrowers must meet the following to qualify for PSLF:

To make sure you’re on track, you can submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Employment Certification Form every year or when you change jobs. But unfortunately, many borrowers have been confused about whether their jobs qualify.



One of the most common reasons for rejection—24% of applications, according to the latest report—is missing information. This refers to the borrower’s missing employment certification. Luckily, the PSLF Help Tool has a new feature that may make the process easier.

Last month, the Department of Education announced an upgrade to the PSLF Help Tool. The update includes an employer search feature. You can now use your company’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN or EIN) and employment dates to see if your work qualifies.



The system will provide one of three statuses: eligible, ineligible, or likely ineligible for PSLF. “Likely ineligible” means the employer is tax-exempt but not a 501(c) organization. It may mean the Department hasn’t decided if your organization is eligible yet—but according to the website, you shouldn’t count on it.

This new update makes it easier to see if your work qualifies and may prevent you from submitting ineligible forms. The Department says it will continue to monitor and update the database.

69,"Jul 9, 2020",Yahoo Finance,Biden-Sanders task force proposes forgiving certain student debt,"As the country inches closer to the November elections amid the coronavirus pandemic, Democratic candidate Joe Biden has emphasized his plan to address the student debt crisis.

Biden’s presidential campaign released a document Wednesday that took into account policy recommendations proposed by its joint task forces, including from supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Then 110-page document — which involved six joint task forces — runs the gamut on issues as varied as climate change, raising the minimum wage, and student loan debt.

On student debt, the Biden-Sanders team met in the middle on the idea of debt cancellation. (During his campaign, Sanders proposed to eliminate all student debt).

“Roughly six in 10 jobs require at least some education beyond high school, and yet the ever-rising cost of college tuition and fees leaves higher education out of reach—or saddles students with a lifetime of debt,” the document stated.

Key highlights

Tuition-fee college: The task force’s proposal makes public colleges and universities tuition-free for students from families that make less than $125,000; double the maximum Pell Grant award for low-income students; and “increase federal support for programs that help first-generation students,” as well as those with disabilities, veterans, and underrepresented groups who are applying for college.

Forgiveness for all amid COVID-19: The plan would “authorize up to $10,000 in student debt relief per borrower to help families weather this crisis.” It’s worth noting that Biden is not mirroring Sanders’ plan to cancel all students debt, but instead cancelling a part of it for public service workers.

Forgiveness for some borrowers: The task force recommends forgiving all undergraduate tuition-related federal debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities, as well as those who graduate from private Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions for borrowers who earn up to $125,000.

Forgiveness for low-income borrowers: The task force would also help low-income borrowers by capping and/or pausing debt payments: His proposal is to pause monthly billing and suspend interest for those earning less than $25,000. Those earning more than $25,000 would have their payments capped at no more than 5% of their discretionary income. After 20 years, their remaining debt would be “automatically forgiven.”

Bankruptcy : The proposal lays out a plan that would rejuvenate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to “take action against exploitative lenders and will work with Congress to allow student debt to be discharged during bankruptcy.” The current process is complicated, burdensome, and quite difficult, as lawyer Austin Smith has explained in a previous interview to Yahoo Finance.

Public service loan forgiveness : The task force recommends reforming this program, which has been criticized for its shortcomings — including a 99% rejection rate at one point — to make enrollment “automatic” for those who qualify, such as teachers, and those working in government agencies and non-profit organizations.

PSLF forgiveness: They also propose to “make the program more generous” by offering a tiered cancellation totaling $50,000 for public service workers: Forgiving up to $10,000 in student debt per year for up to 5 years. (This is similar to a bill Democratic senators have introduced.)

Forgiveness for teachers: Educators in particular will get up to $50,000 of their student debt forgiven.

For-profit colleges: Under these proposals, for-profit colleges would face a more restrictive enviroment: “The Trump Administration has let for-profit colleges and universities once again prey upon students with impunity by repealing important protections.” It proposes to tighten requirements on how for-profit colleges “demonstrate their value and effectiveness before becoming eligible for federal student loans.” The new Secretary of Education to re-instate borrower defense, and forgive loans held by defrauded students who attended predatory for-profit colleges. It will also protect veterans and service members from ending up in bad programs.

Consumer advocates were pleased with the recommendations, but pushed for broader cancellation — particularly amid the COVID-19 health crisis.

Story continues

""Student debt cancellation is now squarely part of major presidential platforms and that is a great step towards creating real progress … [but] we need relief for everyone who is impacted by student loan debt, which includes people with private loans from banks, people who attended private colleges, and others carrying debt from education expenses like textbooks, housing, and food,” Natalia Abrams, executive director of advocacy group Student Debt Crisis, told Yahoo Finance.

If you’re starting, or continuing, your nursing career and need to borrow money in order to pay for your education, you're facing some tough questions: How to pay? What kind of loans to go with? Should you go with private or federal? Does it matter?

With everything you may be juggling right now, you may be tempted to take the easiest route to financing (whatever that may be) so you can move on with your life. But spending some time really understanding your options may save you a lot of money later on.

In this article, we’ll explain:

The basics of student loans What private student loans are The pros and cons of private student loans How to choose the right loan for you

>> Compare Private Student Loan Rates*

Student Loans 101

Before taking out any kind of student loan, you need to understand a few important factors.

1) Credit Rating

Your credit score impacts the kinds of loans you can receive from a bank and the kind of interest rate you’ll be offered. If you have great credit, the lender sees you as a low-risk borrower, therefore they may be willing to give you a lower rate when lending you money. For borrowers with not-so-great credit, or who just haven’t built up much of a credit history yet, you can expect a higher interest rate because the lender sees you as less of a safe bet.

2) Interest

The interest rate is the amount you’ll be charged for the money you’re borrowing. These can be either fixed rates or variable rates.

Fixed Rates: Fixed interest rates are locked in when you sign and cannot change over the course of the loan. They are usually higher than variable rates, but there are fewer unknowns.

Fixed interest rates are locked in when you sign and cannot change over the course of the loan. They are usually higher than variable rates, but there are fewer unknowns. Variable Rates: Variable rates tend to start off lower, but they come with a risk: if interest rates go up, so do those for all variable-rate loans.

Since the Great Recession, rates have only gone downward and borrowers with variable loans have only benefited from them. But the economy is currently in an unpredictable place and no one knows when, or if, we’ll see higher interest rates.

Most private student loan lenders offer a choice between fixed- and variable-rate loans, while all federal student loans have fixed rates.

When Does Interest Start Accruing?

The other important factor you need to keep in mind with interest is when does it start accruing? This depends on the type of loan you took out. With Direct Subsidized Federal Loans (more on those later) you don’t accrue interest while you’re in school and for 6 months after you graduate because the federal government is covering it. With private loans and Unsubsidized Federal Loans, you’ll typically start accruing interest immediately.

3) Lender

The type of lender you go with -- either the government for federal loans or a private lender like a bank -- makes a big difference in the terms and conditions of the loan. We’ll go into that in greater depth later in this article.

4) Fees

Most federal student loans come with loan origination fees that cost a percentage of the loan amount. They exist to pay the costs the lender incurs when issuing the loan. Private loans sometimes have loan origination fees, but can also have additional fees such as application fees, early and late payment fees, payment return fees, forbearance and deferment fees and refinancing fees.

5) Cosigners

Cosigning a loan is having someone else, like a family member or exceptionally good friend, put their name on the loan with you. Most federal student loans don’t require a cosigner, but a private loan may. If you have low credit and a bank deems you too risky to lend to, you may need to have a cosigner on your loan. If you have a cosigner with great credit, it can get you a lower interest rate.

But (besides your love and gratitude), there are no upsides for the cosigner and some potentially disastrous downsides. If you fall far behind on your payments, they could end up having to pay off your entire loan immediately in one go. And their own credit could take an incalculable hit.

6) Repayment

Obtaining loans is one thing, but you also need to consider how you’ll pay them off, how long the repayment period is, and when you’ll need to start repaying them. Most federal loans and some private loans allow you to wait until 6 months after you’ve graduated to begin paying them, but some may not. You need to look over your loan agreement carefully to check these terms.

Private Student Loans vs. Federal Loans

Now that you’ve got the basics of student loans down, let’s explore the differences between private loans and federal loans.

Federal Student Loans Are Often Your Best Option

Federal loans can be a student’s best option in most circumstances. Federal Student loans are loans provided by the US government and they have some benefits built in like fixed interest rates and excellent terms.

Types of Federal Student Loans

There are two main types of federal student loans. According to Peg Keough, College Financial Planning Consultant and Founder of Way to the Quad, “There's subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans. Depending on the parent’s, or student’s, financial situation, they might get a combination or they might just get unsubsidized -- but they're the best ones out there.”

Direct Subsidized: These are federal student loans that don’t accrue interest while you’re in school because the government is subsidizing them. These are available to students who have financial need. They have fixed interest rates and there’s no minimum credit score required to get them.

These are federal student loans that don’t accrue interest while you’re in school because the government is subsidizing them. These are available to students who have financial need. They have fixed interest rates and there’s no minimum credit score required to get them. Direct Unsubsidized: These are also federal student loans, but the government doesn’t subsidize your interest, so you’ll start accruing interest as soon as you take out the loan. However, you won’t be required to start paying them off until 6 months after you graduate.

To apply for a federal student loan, you’ll need to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

Benefits of Federal Student Loans

Federal Student Loans can come with important benefits including:

Fixed Interest Rates: As we touched on earlier, fixed rates mean that your rate can’t fluctuate over time. And, as Keough points out, federal rates are really low right now. “For this school year coming up, the interest rate is 2.75%, partially because of what's going on in the country, the Fed has been lowering interest rates.” For undergraduate Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized student loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2020, the interest rate is fixed at 2.75%, and for graduate students, it’s fixed at 4.3%.

Financial Protections: The federal government has some financial protections in place to protect borrowers such as the current 0% interest and automatic forbearance happening as a result of COVID-19.

The federal government has some financial protections in place to protect borrowers such as the current 0% interest and automatic forbearance happening as a result of COVID-19. Repayment Benefits: Federal student loans have a number of repayment benefits built into them that private loans do not. These include things like income-driven repayment plans, and student loan forgiveness options. These are particularly important for nursing students, as there are a number of student loan forgiveness programs available for nurses.

Federal Loan Caps

Federal loans are great, but they have their limits, literally. Federal programs cap the amount you can borrow: In 2020, undergraduate loans are capped at $31,000 for dependent students (those still considered to be dependent on their parents), $57,500 for independent students, with no more of $23,000 in subsidized loans. For graduate students, the cap is $138,500, with a cap of $65,500 in subsidized loans.

Federal loans also have yearly caps in addition to their overall caps. Meaning that you have a set amount of federal loans available to you in your freshman, sophomore, junior and senior years. And if you don’t use them within that year, they’ll disappear. It’s a “use it or lose it” situation according to Keough. She points out that many people think “I have some money in 529, I'm not taking out loans. And then by junior year, it's all gone and they haven't taken advantage of really good loans, freshmen and sophomore year.”

She wants everyone to understand that college is a “four year cash flow” and you have to plan to finance it all. Part of that planning, if your federal loans won’t cover all of your financial needs, is considering private student loans.

Pros and Cons of Private Student Loans

According to Keough, “The key thing about private loans is: Don't make the assumption that they're similar to the direct student loans the federal government's offering. You're getting these from a private bank, a credit union, or Sallie Mae.” Keough adds that some of the main differences are “the interest rates can be variable,” “they usually require a cosigner,” and “there are different things you have to think about that you would never have to think about with the federal loans.”

Pros of Private Student Loans

1. They Can Be a Source of Funding When You’ve Maxed Out Your Federal Loans

As we mentioned above, there are limits to the amount of federal loans you can take out. Once you’ve reached those limits, private loans can help fill the gaps. Many students borrow as much as they can using federal programs, and then switch to private lenders to top up their funding.

2. They Can Be Less Expensive

If you have really good credit, you might be in line for savings by opting for a private student loan. But rates on private loans are typically high for people with poor or fair credit -- and even those at the lower end of the good-credit range. So most are likely better off with federal loans.

As of the date this was written (current rates may be different) highly creditworthy borrowers could get rates as low as 1.24% variable for a new loan and fixed interest rates from 3.75% APR.*

Cons of Private Student Loans

Private student loans do come with some considerable downsides. The main cons of private student loans include:

Higher rates for most borrowers. Fees to set up your loan, though federal student loans come with origination fees as well. They lack the protection of sustained income-related payments if you hit hard times. They don’t provide loan forgiveness in return for public service, and they don’t discharge or cancel loans in the ways federal programs occasionally do. They may start charging interest the moment you receive your funds. None of the federal subsidies on interest that subsidized federal student loans have. Refinancing federal debt to a private student loan is a one-way street -- You can’t later change your mind and go back to federal funding. But you can refinance existing private student debt to get a lower rate or payment You may need a cosigner in order to get a private student loan.

Choosing the Right Loans for You

So, how do you make your student loan decision? Keough recommends weighing all your options, “You should definitely check on private student loans. I've seen people get really good private student loan rates, that have great credit.” She says, “You could find a bank that locks in the interest rate and, if you have great credit because you're an older person and you've been financially responsible up until that point, it could match it.”

If you don’t have awesome credit (or someone willing to cosign your loan), federal loans may be your best option until you reach the limits.

Takeaways: Here’s What You Need to Consider When Getting Student Loans

Whenever you borrow large sums of money, it pays to do so cautiously. Get quotes from multiple lenders and compare them carefully. And remember to check:

What your rate and monthly payments will be

Whether the rate you’ll pay is fixed or variable

If you have to pay fees to set up the loan

The repayment period

When you start accruing interest -- While you’re studying, when you graduate or after that

Whether there’s a chance of loan forgiveness

What might happen if you later get into financial difficulties and can’t keep up with payments

Student loans are, no doubt, a major topic in the national political conversation. Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden is calling for federal loan forgiveness for borrowers making less than $125,000 per year. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has allowed an interest-free halt for most federal student loan repayment due to the coronavirus pandemic.

But what changes can borrowers expect to see based on the results of the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election? In order to get an idea, we spoke with five student loan experts to gauge their predictions.

While all of them agreed that future policy could look very different depending on who wins, most don’t foresee major changes without congressional support.

Here’s a look at expectations …

If Pres. Donald Trump wins reelection …

The Trump administration has made some student loan policy changes over the last 3.5 years, including efforts to limit student loan discharge through the borrower defense to repayment rule and to ease loan forgiveness for disabled veterans.

As for further student loan moves, the White House has called for streamlining the four income-driven repayment (IDR) plans currently on offer by combining them into a single plan, a move that might happen if Trump is reelected.

This new IDR plan, originally proposed during Trump’s 2016 campaign, would cap borrowers’ monthly repayment amount at 12.5% of their discretionary income. It would also decrease the repayment term for undergraduates to 15 years, but would increase the term for graduate students to 30 years.

President Trump has also sought, through his annual budget bills, to repeal the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF), though Congress hasn’t taken up this proposal.

But student loan lawyer Adam Minsky doesn’t expect any big borrower-focused changes in a second Trump term.

“If Trump wins reelection, we are unlikely to see significant student loan reforms, if we are basing predictions on what we have seen thus far in the last four years,” Minsky told Student Loan Hero. “No significant changes to student loan programs to benefit borrowers have been enacted in the last four years, other than the CARES Act, which provides only temporary relief.”

Michael Lux, attorney and founder of The Student Loan Sherpa, echoes these sentiments. “If Trump wins reelection, expect things to continue in the status quo,” he said. “To date, Trump has done very little to help manage the student loan crisis, and there isn’t any indication that a second term would be any different.”

Student loan lawyer Joshua Cohen is likewise pessimistic about what a Trump administration would mean for student loan borrowers, based on his view of its leadership at the Department of Education.

Current Education Secretary “Betsy DeVos is loath to help borrowers … expect nothing but worse,” he said, pointing to lawsuits against her over tax refund garnishments, PSLF implementation and other issues.

If Biden wins the election …

It makes sense that a change in president would result in big changes to policy, as agreed upon by the experts.

“If Biden wins and has a Democratic-majority Congress, we might see bolder reforms, including some form of widespread student loan forgiveness, which has the support of House Democrats, Senate Democrats and Biden himself, particularly in the wake of the pandemic and economic collapse,” said Minsky.

Biden has proposed mass student loan forgiveness for borrowers who make less than $125,000 per year, as well as providing immediate cancellation of $10,000 for all borrowers due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lux notes that “Biden has also proposed an [automatic] income-driven repayment plan that requires borrowers to pay 5% of their discretionary income towards their federal loans.”

“This could cut federal payments in half for borrowers, and it can be done regardless of who controls Congress,” he said.

Lux also believes a Biden presidency would restore the previous version of the borrower defense to repayment, as well as “clean up the Public Service Loan Forgiveness confusion” by streamlining the process.

Biden has also expressed his support for allowing bankruptcy discharge of student loans — a change from his previous position. (He had backed creating the current student loan bankruptcy rules in 2005.)

If there is a divided government …

Regardless of the significant differences between the candidates, borrowers are unlikely to see much change if there is a divided government — whether the parties split control of Congress and the White House, or if Congress itself is divided.

Some student loan changes can be made without Congress, via an executive order. But Minsky says that for Biden at least, it’s not certain this would be the likely method for reform.

“Elizabeth Warren and other consumer advocates have argued that a president can enact widespread [federal] student loan forgiveness … without Congressional action, under existing regulations,” Minsky said. “However, Biden, who is a long-time institutionalist, is unlikely to take such dramatic action without Congressional involvement.”

Instead, he said, borrowers can expect more subtle changes under a Biden presidency.

“If Biden wins the presidency and has a divided or Republican-majority Congress, we could see some modest reforms in areas that have bipartisan agreement, such as simplifying and improving income-driven repayment plans and restoring the Obama-era regulations for the borrower defense to repayment program,” said Minsky.

Minsky noted that Trump recently vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have restored some earlier borrower defense to repayment protections, so such a move could well happen if Biden becomes president, regardless of who runs Congress.

Cohen says that both Democrats and Republicans will need to find a middle ground before borrowers will see any reforms.

“There needs to be real partisanship here,” he said. “The message must always be how it helps a conservative and liberal agenda, how both sides win. If the story is always about returning money to the tax base, through motivating student loan payment plans, this could work.”

However, Mark Kantrowitz, financial aid expert and founder and VP of publishing for SavingforCollege.com, says that even with legislative support, he doesn’t personally expect mass student loan forgiveness anytime soon.

“It would be highly unlikely that Trump or Biden would cancel student debt as a result of the 2020 election,” said Kantrowitz. “However, a Biden administration could make the current paths to student loan forgiveness significantly easier.”

On the other hand, Lux expects the current period of emergency federal loan forbearance to continue past its deadline of Sept. 30, 2020, if only for political reasons.

“It would be shocking to see any politician be in favor of raising student loan interest rates a month before an election,” he said. “Borrowers may see 0% interest on their federal loans into 2021, regardless of who wins the election.”","Student Loan Hero is a completely free website 100% focused on helping student loan borrowers get the answers they need.

More than half of all private student loan borrowers in the U.S. have lost income since the coronavirus pandemic struck. To make matters worse, their private loans are ineligible for the government’s penalty-free repayment pause granted on most federal loans.

Fortunately, however, about 70% of private loan-holders who have requested relief directly from their lenders have received it, according to our new survey of 1,000-plus borrowers.

And yet, it’s not always enough — 30% of respondents reported strongly considering bankruptcy since the beginning of March.

Key findings:

Approximately 54% of private loan borrowers requested a reprieve from their lender due to COVID-19. Male borrowers (65%) were significantly more likely to seek help than female borrowers (42%). (Read more)

Struggling private loan borrowers frustrated by lack of federal relief

With the coronavirus relief act passed by Congress at the end of March, millions of federal student loan borrowers were given a 0% interest, six-month vacation from repayment. Unfortunately, the law left millions of borrowers uncovered.

In fact 8 in 10 private loan borrowers responding to our survey said they felt like they’ve been left out to dry by the federal pandemic-relief packages so far. Exacerbating their plight: Many borrowers due to receive relief checks could lose the funds to creditors just as it hits their bank accounts if they have delinquent loans.

Making matters worse, a narrow majority (51%) of private loan borrowers said their earnings have taken a hit from the coronavirus outbreak.

Democrats in Congress have since called to expand benefits to some currently ineligible borrowers. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill in mid-May to extend the repayment suspension and deliver $10,000 worth of forgiveness to borrowers with ineligible loans. These include privately-held Federal Family Education Loans, school-sourced Perkins loans and loans from state governments, banks, credit unions and online companies.

The Republican-controlled Senate has yet to take up the proposal. But fortunately, some borrowers are finding assistance elsewhere.

Private loan borrowers seek help from lenders

For some with private loans, help has arrived from a seemingly unlikely source: private lenders and refinancing companies.

A large segment of lenders is advertising a range of relief options for their customers, including forbearance periods. These are repayment pauses that typically still allow interest to accrue but won’t damage the borrower’s credit — although some have reported unfairly dinged credit scores anyway.

Lenders have been very responsive overall: Just about 10% of borrowers who contacted their lender seeking relief were turned down completely. And while roughly 20% didn’t receive monthslong payment suspensions, they did obtain some other form of support.

Overall, respondents said, they were offered the following types of aid:

Payment deadline extensions (66%)

Waived late fees (48%)

Reduced minimum payments (36%)

Men appeared more likely than women — 65% versus 42% — to ask their private lender for a break. (Note that a previous Student Loan Hero survey showed male employees also more likely to ask for a raise at work).

There was a clear generational trend, too: Millennials were more prone to seek assistance (58% of them did), as compared with:

Gen X (55%)

Gen Z (51%)

Baby boomers (35%)

Seeking help wasn’t limited to those in the most dire straits. Almost 45% of borrowers whose income hadn’t been harmed by the pandemic-paused economy still pursued private loan repayment relief. Such proactive moves can help give borrowers space to build up their emergency fund in case of a job layoff or other financial stress from the economic recession.

On the other hand, not asking for help (even when it’s available) continues to be a problem for student loan borrowers of all stripes. The primary reason — cited by 38% — was simply not knowing it’s an option, while another 8% of respondents said they didn’t believe such a request would be successful.

Private loan relief or not, some borrowers consider bankruptcy

Historically, discharging student debt via bankruptcy has been extremely difficult, but perception is partly responsible for reality. Bankruptcy attorneys might leave student debt off of filing due to the fact that they’re rarely discharged in court. In fact, only about 400 of the 250,000 student loan borrowers who go bankrupt each year seek a student loan discharge, according to academic research cited by the Wall Street Journal in January 2020.

However, headlines showing student debt being forgiven by bankruptcy could be shifting attitudes. And this, in turn, could help to explain why close to 34% of private loan borrowers whose income was impacted by the ongoing recession said they had strongly considered bankruptcy over the last three months.

In fact, a stunning 40% of Gen X borrowers with private education debt reported “strongly” mulling such a move, compared with …

27% of millennials

19% of Gen Zers

11% of baby boomers

Gen X, it should be noted, carries higher average balances than peers of other generations, according to our student loan coronavirus data snapshot.

Bankruptcy is an extreme strategy that should only be considered a last resort for student loan borrowers (and consumers, in general). Student Loan Hero recommends that borrowers first try righting their student loan repayment or pursuing loan forgiveness opportunities and loan repayment assistance programs before subjecting their finances to a judge.

Where private loan borrowers can seek help with student debt

Borrowers welcome relief from the federal government and their private lenders. With or without their support, however, many borrowers are left wanting or needing more.

Fortunately, some state governments are offering student debt help, with various governors reaching agreements with lenders in their states to give borrowers a reprieve that won’t damage their credit reports. Try contacting your state’s higher education authority (via the Department of Education’s contact map) for information about support programs.

Private loan borrowers with good credit (or a creditworthy cosigner) can also consider student loan refinancing. This groups a borrower’s private loans with a single new lender that could potentially carry a lower overall interest rate or reduced monthly payment.

Be careful about refinancing federal loans, however, because repayment on those is currently suspended, and even when it resumes, you would lose access to government-exclusive protections like income-driven repayment.

Meanwhile, borrowers who have considered taking the drastic step of going to court should weigh debt consolidation versus bankruptcy. Having all information handy before choosing a loan repayment strategy is imperative if borrowers are to make the best of a bad situation.","Student Loan Hero is a completely free website 100% focused on helping student loan borrowers get the answers they need.

The override effort, which would have revived bipartisan legislation to overturn regulations put in place last year by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, failed by a vote of 238 to 173, lacking the two-thirds majority it would have needed to pass. Six Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to defy Mr. Trump’s position.

“It was important to try,” said Representative Susie Lee, Democrat of Nevada, who led the effort. “You have 350,000 students in this country who are waiting for relief.

“They can’t get on with their lives,” she added. “This is a rule that’s clearly stacked in favor of predatory schools and against students.”","WASHINGTON — The House tried and failed on Friday to invalidate stringent rules imposed by the Trump administration on student loan forgiveness, falling short of overriding a veto by President Trump.

76,"Jun 26, 2020",Medical Economics,How the CARES Act affects medical student loans,"The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law in late March, included important changes that affect many physicians with student loans, according to Andrew Musbach, C.F.P., co-founder and financial advisor with MD Wealth Management, LLC, in Chelsea, Mich.

Musbach recently spoke with Medical Economics to explain these changes and offer advice to physicians on how they can optimize their student loans.

Medical Economics: What are some of the changes in the CARES Act that are relevant for physicians with student loans?

Musbach: The biggest change is that all federal direct loan payments were suspended until September 30, 2020. In addition to suspending loan payments, the CARES Act sets the interest rate at 0 percent through September 30, so there’s nothing accruing on these student loans.

The six months of $0 payments (April through September 2020) still count as qualifying payments for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which requires 120 monthly payments before the entire balance is forgiven. So if you are pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness, you get six months of credit for payments without actually paying anything.

The best part is that there’s nothing you need to do proactively to take advantage of these changes. The federal direct loan payments were stopped automatically, so you don’t have to log into your federal loan servicer’s website and stop the payments or request forbearance. Just realize that your balance will be the same on September 30 as it is today.

Medical Economics: What do these changes mean if physicians are still in training and aren’t sure if they will pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness?

Musbach: To even be eligible for loan forgiveness, you need to be directly employed full-time at a qualifying 501(c)(3) non-profit organization or a government agency. But if you’re like many physicians just starting your career in medicine, you may not be sure if you want to work at a non-profit or government agency right after training or go into private practice.

So if you’re not sure if you’re going to pursue loan forgiveness, I recommend not making any voluntary loan payments through September 2020. That’s because if you think there’s a chance you’ll get Public Service Loan Forgiveness, the best strategy is to make the least amount of payments so you get the highest possible amount forgiven. Instead, you can use your increased cash flow to make retirement contributions through your 403(b) at work or your own Roth IRA.

Medical Economics: How does the CARES Act affect physicians with loans who are certain they will not pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness, such as those who want to move immediately into private practice?

Musbach: If you are not pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness on your federal loans and your cash flow is good, you have two options.

The first option is that you could continue to make the same loan payments that you normally would from now through September 2020 to pay down accrued interest or principal. But if you decide to make these voluntary payments, we recommend waiting until September to make all of the payments at once in one lump sum amount. That way, you can put the money into a savings account and earn some interest for a few months.

The second option is that you could make pre-tax contributions to your retirement savings, which also lowers your tax bill. You might want to get a head start on saving for retirement because over the long term, you could earn more from investing the money versus using it to pay off your debt if your loan has a relatively low interest rate.

Medical Economics: What if a physician has a private loan and is having trouble with cash flow because of the pandemic. What options do they have?

Musbach: The CARES Act only applies to federal loans, which is what most physicians have. So the changes don’t apply to private loans.

Some private lenders are offering forbearance, but the interest will still accrue, so it’s not an ideal strategy. But if you need to apply for forbearance to survive the next couple of months, that may be an option available to you. If so, you need to apply directly with the lender.

You might also be able to make smaller payments just to pay down some of the interest, so not as much accrues over that forbearance period.

Taking out money to pay for college isn’t the easiest decision to make, especially if you’re worried about eventually paying it back. With the U.S. now in a recession, you may not know what the future holds when it comes to your education or your career.

Are student loans worth it? Regardless of where you are in your borrowing journey, here’s how to determine if taking out student loans is the right choice for you.

Questions to ask yourself before borrowing

Borrowing money for school isn’t a quick decision. Before you take out loans, ask yourself a few questions first.

What’s my ROI on my preferred major?

Your designated career path starts with your major. Some jobs don’t pay as well as others, which means that if you pick one that doesn’t have a high income attached, you may spend a long time paying off your loans or struggling to pay them back at all.

If you’re unsure about the return on investment of your potential career, check out what your job could pay through the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You can also compare on Salary.com and Glassdoor. If you’re torn between majors, checking out salaries might help you pick one.

How much should I borrow?

The amount you borrow in loans depends on how much you need. If you have scholarships and grants, you may not need to take out as much as you would if you didn’t have free money. If you didn’t receive scholarships and grants, you’ll need to borrow enough to cover all of the costs you can’t afford out of pocket.

To avoid borrowing — and then repaying — a lot of money, try applying for scholarships and grants. Also see if your family has any money saved up for your college education; the less you have to cover with student loans, the less you’ll have to pay in interest.

What’s my repayment plan?

Before you take on student loan debt, consider your future repayment plan. Federal student loans and many private student loans start repayment six months after you graduate or drop below half-time enrollment. This is helpful if you don’t land a job in your field straight out of college or if it takes you a while to come up with regular payments.

If you have federal student loans, you can follow the standard repayment plan, consolidate multiple loans into one, try an income-driven repayment plan or, depending on your career path, apply for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

If you’ve exhausted all of your federal student loan options, you might want to look at private student loan rates. These types of loans don’t have the same repayment term options, but you may find a repayment term that better fits your budget. If you need to adjust your repayment plan, you may qualify for a loan refinance.

Additional factors to consider

The worth of student loans depends on many different factors, including where you go to school, how much you borrow and how you’ll be able to repay your loans. Be mindful of considerations like:

Loans aren’t free. It’s easy to think about using money now and not giving it back for years later. But even though you don’t have to pay back the entirety of your loan when you graduate, loans are still a monthly financial commitment. And the longer you take to pay them off, the more you’ll have to pay in interest.

But even though you don’t have to pay back the entirety of your loan when you graduate, loans are still a monthly financial commitment. And the longer you take to pay them off, the more you’ll have to pay in interest. Repayment isn’t quick. The standard repayment plan for federal student loans is 10 years, and income-driven repayment plans are 20 or 25 years. Even though monthly payments might be manageable based on your income, that’s a long time to be paying for a school you only attended for a few years.

Some schools carry prestige and weight, but that usually means that they come with a hefty price tag. Expensive colleges aren’t necessarily better because they’re pricey; you can attend community colleges or take online courses to save on the cost of college.

Expensive colleges aren’t necessarily better because they’re pricey; you can attend community colleges or take online courses to save on the cost of college. You’re not guaranteed anything. Whether it’s graduation or a high-paying job, nothing about your future is guaranteed. That means if you take out six-figure loans, you have to pay them back regardless of if you have a six-figure income.

Whether it’s graduation or a high-paying job, nothing about your future is guaranteed. That means if you take out six-figure loans, you have to pay them back regardless of if you have a six-figure income. Loans aren’t your only option. You don’t have to only take out student loans to pay for school. Utilize all of your free resources first, including scholarships, grants and any dedicated college savings. It’s also smart to use federal student loans before moving onto private student loans, as they come with more borrower protections.

The bottom line

Whether or not you should take out student loans depends mostly on your career path, financial situation and school. If you already have college costs covered through free money like scholarships and grants, you may not need to take out student loans. However, if you attend an expensive university or didn’t qualify for free money, student loans might be necessary.

79,"Jun 23, 2020",InvestmentNews,TIAA tackles student debt with startup Savi,"TIAA announced Monday it has teamed up with fintech startup Savi to help financial planners and clients navigate the second-highest consumer debt facing the nation: student loans.

The amount of outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. has reached $1.6 trillion this year, according to Educationdata.org, owed by 44.7 million borrowers. Student loan debt ranks second to mortgage debt surpassing the amount of auto loan and credit card debt.

TIAA and Savi launched a student debt tech tool targeted to help an organizations’ employees reduce their monthly student loan payments and to qualify for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, the company noted.

“Historically, the PSLF program has presented challenges for some borrowers due to difficulty understanding the rules and managing the paperwork,” according to a company statement. In fact, 99% of program applicants have been rejected for not meeting program requirements or due to missing or incomplete information on a form, according to data from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Financial planners, institutions and individuals can leverage the tool without any IT involvement required. Clients sign up by answering a few questions and from there the Savi software will determine an income-driven repayment plan and whether the client may qualify for the loan forgiveness program. Savi’s algorithm takes into account an individual’s specific circumstances, including their family and tax situation.

TIAA, which boasts $1.1 trillion in assets under management as of March 31, conducted a pilot with the three-year-old startup from July 2019 through March with seven nonprofit institutions, four in higher education and three in healthcare. During the pilot phase, employees that signed up saved an average of $1,700 a year in student debt payments and had an average projected forgiveness of more than $50,000 upon successful completion of 120 months in the PSLF program.

The total projected forgiveness from the pilot exceeds $53 million to date, according to TIAA.

University of Pittsburgh, for one, adopted the solution in March, said John Kozar, the university’s assistant vice chancellor of human resources. “In a very short period of time, participants have a calculated average loan forgiveness exceeding $55,000,” he said. “There is also an immediate savings with the reduction in loan repayments that are averaging $100 per month. Among our participants, the total debt that may be forgiven exceeds $14 million.”

Even the most diligent student loan borrowers face challenges navigating the “confusing maze of federal student loan repayment and forgiveness options,” said Aaron Smith, Savi co-founder. “After seeing the impact during our pilot with TIAA, we are excited to expand to the broader TIAA community of client institutions and their employees.”","TIAA announced Monday it has teamed up with fintech startup Savi to help financial planners and clients navigate the second-highest consumer debt facing the nation: student loans.

80,"Jun 22, 2020",Fox Business,What the CARES Act means for your student loans — everything you need to know,"The federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act created a number of initiatives to help Americans who are struggling financially as a result of the coronavirus crisis. A key part of the Act was designed to offer relief to borrowers who owe federal student loans. Here's what you need to know about the CARES Act and student loans.

What the CARES Act does for student loan borrowers

If you owe federal student loans, there are a few ways the CARES Act can help make them more manageable. The most important benefits include:

Student loan payments are suspended through September 30, 2020 for Direct Loans and Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL)

No interest accrues on your loans during this temporarily student loan forbearance period

Suspended student loan payments will still count toward the required payments for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)

Not making payments to loans eligible for forbearance during this time won't count against your credit history

Collection actions for federal student loans, including tax refund offsets, wage garnishments and social security garnishments, are suspended temporarily

Your employer can pay up to $5,250 toward your student loan debt for you through the end of 2020, without it being counted as part of your taxable income

Of those benefits, the most helpful may be student loan forbearance. Being able to temporarily pause payments through the end of September could be welcome if coronavirus has caused you to take a pay cut.

Who qualifies for CARES Act student loan relief

CARES Act benefits are designed to help you if you owe federal student loans. That includes:

Direct Loans (including Stafford, Grad PLUS, Parent PLUS and Consolidation loans)

FFEL Loans

Perkins Loans that are held by the U.S. Department of Education

If you have FFEL or Perkins Loans owned by a third-party lender that isn't connected to the Department of Education, the CARES Act provisions won't extend to them. You also won't qualify for student loan forbearance and other benefits for private student loans. But you can check with your loan servicer to see if they offer relief options, such as deferment or forbearance periods, or consider a refinance of the loan. An online marketplace like Credible can help you find the right plan for you.

STUDENT REFINANCING RATES GOING DOWN - HERE'S WHY

How to manage student loan forbearance

If your federal student loans are currently in forbearance under the CARES Act, you may have questions like:

Should I pay my student loans during forbearance if I can afford it?

How will student loan forbearance affect my credit score?

Can forbearance help me avoid default?

If you're able to pay your loans during a forbearance period, doing so could help make a larger dent in what you owe. According to the Department of Education, payments made during the temporary forbearance period are applied directly to your loan principal.

HOW TO IDENTIFY STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF SCAMS

In terms of credit score impact, the CARES Act says that any suspended payments owed during the forbearance period will be reported to the credit bureaus as if you'd made them. And if you fell behind on loan payments prior to the Act's enforcement, debt collectors are not allowed to contact you about your loans through Sept. 30, 2020.

But the Act won't erase any late or missed payments that were previously reported to the credit bureaus. If you're in danger of defaulting on federal student loans, the Act may delay it but not prevent it if you don't reach out to your lender to discuss long-term solutions.

Should I refinance my student loans?

Refinancing student loans is something you may consider if you have private student loans and are interested in getting a lower interest rate. With refinancing, you're getting a new loan to pay off your existing student loans, ideally with a lower rate and a lower monthly payment. You can use Credible's free online tool to compare multiple lenders within minutes.

10 OF THE BEST STUDENT LOAN REFINANCE COMPANIES

Refinancing private student loans typically involves a credit check so you may need to consider having a cosigner to qualify. If you're interested in a refinance, take time to estimate your potential interest savings and your new monthly student loan payments to determine if it makes sense.

Other ways to manage student loans during coronavirus

Student loan forbearance can help if you're having difficulty making loan payments because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most important thing to remember is that this is only temporary and you'll need to review your budget to make sure you can continue making payments once forbearance ends.

If you're still having a hard time with loan payments beyond September, there are other options. For example, you may be eligible for a deferment that would allow you to pause payments temporarily. Or you may consider consolidation for federal loans to streamline monthly payments.

Switching from a standard repayment plan to an income-driven repayment plan could also help if your income hasn't recovered to pre-coronavirus levels. An income-driven plan won't reduce your student loan interest rate but it can make monthly payments more affordable. Talking to your loan servicer can help you explore all the available options.","Here's what you need to know about the CARES Act and student loans.

81,"Jun 22, 2020",Business Wire,New TIAA and Savi Solution Provides Significant Student Debt Relief,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TIAA, a leading financial services provider, today announced that it is working with social impact technology startup Savi to make it easier for nonprofit institutions to offer a meaningful student debt relief solution to their employees. The companies together launched a student debt solution designed to help employees of nonprofit organizations reduce their monthly student loan payments immediately, and to qualify over time for relief from the balance of their federal student loans by enrolling in the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.

TIAA and Savi conducted a pilot of the solution from July 2019 through March 2020 with seven nonprofit institutions, four in higher education and three in healthcare. Within that period, employees who signed up for the solution were on track to save an average of $1,700 a year in student debt payments. Some employees’ payments were cut in half. In addition, employees had an average projected forgiveness of more than $50,000 upon successful completion of 120 months in the PSLF program. The total projected forgiveness from the pilot exceeds $53,000,000 to date.

Much more than simply a tool or calculator, the solution launched today by TIAA and Savi helps participants successfully navigate the complex rules of the PSLF program. The PSLF program was designed over a decade ago to help the people who dedicate their careers to serving others. Historically, the program has presented challenges for some borrowers due to difficulty understanding the rules and managing the paperwork. In fact, 98 percent of PSLF program applicants have been rejected for not meeting program requirements or due to missing or incomplete information on a form. i Without a solution like Savi, over half of borrowers miss annual deadlines that are key to receiving loan forgiveness.

“Managing debt is a key step toward achieving financial wellness and it is why we are offering this solution,” said Doug Chittenden, Executive Vice President and President of Institutional Relationships at TIAA. “There has never been a more important time to help keep our nonprofit participants on track toward student debt forgiveness. Health care workers on the front lines of this crisis and university faculty and staff focused on administering distance learning programs are under tremendous pressure already. Together with Savi, we’re proud to help enable our participants and other nonprofit employees to take advantage of the significant benefits of the federal PSLF program.”

Assistant Vice Chancellor of HR at the University of Pittsburgh John Kozar said, “The University of Pittsburgh continually seeks benefits and services that can deliver high value at little or no cost. One of the best examples of this is this solution from TIAA and Savi. The University was an early adopter of this program in March 2020, and in a very short period of time, participants have a calculated average loan forgiveness exceeding $55,000. There is also an immediate savings with the reduction in loan repayments that are averaging $100 per month. Amongst our participants, the total debt that may be forgiven exceeds $14 million. Needless to say, we are pleased to make this solution available to all of our employees, and our faculty and staff are delighted with the results. We are grateful for TIAA and Savi’s efforts to recognize and address this important need.”

Employees of Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health, another pilot program participant, have experienced similar success. “This solution from TIAA and Savi is an excellent addition to our suite of employee benefits,” said Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health People Operations Director Gayle Collins. “It is user-friendly, the data is impressive, and it has exceeded our expectations in every way. Most importantly, our employees are telling us it is easy to navigate, it is helping them reduce their monthly loan payments, and it helps ensure they are getting approved for loan forgiveness.”

Savi Co-Founder Aaron Smith said, “Even the most diligent student loan borrowers face challenges navigating the confusing maze of federal student loan repayment and forgiveness options. After seeing the incredible impact during our pilot with TIAA, we are excited to expand to the broader TIAA community of client institutions and their employees.""

How it works

TIAA is offering Savi’s solution to client institutions as a turnkey service to help them significantly expand the financial wellness benefits available to their employees.

Individuals can sign up by answering a few simple questions. From there, the Savi software determines potential savings with an income-driven repayment plan and whether the person may qualify for a forgiveness program. The Savi algorithm takes into account an individual’s specific circumstances, including their family and tax situation, and suggests a solution that best fits their needs. The solution acts like a concierge, helping the individual to stay in compliance with the recurring paperwork requirements of the PSLF program and reducing errors. Savi’s customer success team is standing by to answer questions and act as an advocate if needed.

Employees of nonprofit institutions and their family members are also able to get an initial analysis from the tool at no cost.

This solution offers a client-friendly deployment model that requires no IT involvement by the institution and enables the client to control the communication channels and frequency. A communications toolkit is provided to enable institutions to communicate information in the way that works best for them and their employees.

""I was already working toward forgiveness, but found new savings,” said one TIAA participant and Savi user. “My monthly payment went from $360 to $150 – a reduction by more than half!”

Mr. Chittenden of TIAA said, “TIAA recognizes that new financial realities have emerged for participants as a result of the current economic situation brought about by COVID-19. We strive to help everyone work toward a stable financial future with dignity, purpose, and hope. Managing student loan debt is a key action to help secure long-term financial well-being.”

The preliminary settlement — still subject to final approval by the court — requires Navient to “enhance its internal resources, maintain regular training and monitoring for call center representatives, update forms that are sent to borrowers and update its website.”

Part of the settlement involves Navient providing $1.75 million to a nonprofit organization that will provide education and student loan counseling to public service workers. The 10 plaintiffs, all student borrowers, will receive $15,000 each.

“This exceptional agreement is a big step forward that will help millions of borrowers get the relief they need—and were promised by the federal government—by enhancing the resources available to them through their loan servicer,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which backed the plaintiffs, said in a press release.

‘It was about the most confusing thing I've ever seen’

Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF) in 2007 to help various kinds of public service workers erase their student debt after 10 years of loan payments.

Management of the program is widely considered to be a failure: More than 98% of applications from teachers, firefighters, police, and other public servants are rejected. Several lawsuits have arisen over the last decade.

Issues listed by the plaintiffs in the case settled Friday included: Not informing them of the forgiveness program, which requires 120 on-time payments; not leading the borrowers to the “best possible payment plan” to qualify for the forgiveness; and harming public servants by “routinely providing false information” to the borrowers.

Navient’s actions, the lawsuit alleged, led to them be denied loan forgiveness. Judge Denise Cote dismissed most of the plaintiffs’ claims in July 2019, noting that many of the claims were too vague or lacked documentation. The settlement brings the lawsuit to a close.

Aside from this now-settled lawsuit, other borrowers are directing their PSLF frustrations toward Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

As of April this year (most recent data available), approximately 150,000 borrowers applied for PSLF, the original program. Roughly 1.7% of applications were approved. The average discharged amount was $66,000.

Education Department officials contend that Congress designed the rules to be too restrictive.

Many applications were thrown out over technicalities: The borrower had not made enough qualifying monthly payments — all 120 of them — or had missing information in their paperwork. Or their loans weren’t actually eligible in the first place.

“It was about the most confusing thing I've ever seen in my life, and I'm just being honest,” Ami Sandler, a California-based teacher, told Yahoo Finance in a previous interview. “It was the most tedious, most complicated thing I've ever seen.”

In June, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed a lawsuit targeting the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF) program, which was created as a temporary fix to the PSLF program but also saw a high denial rate. Becerra deemed the temporary program “virtually inaccessible” given its “convoluted application process.”

Terms of the agreement

In particular, Navient has agreed to:

Enhance internal resources for call center representatives, including updating job aids and call flow procedures, implementing new procedures requiring customer service representatives to listen for keywords or phrases indicating PSLF eligibility, and asking leading questions regarding employment by qualifying employers.

Update forms that are sent to borrowers when they consent to loan forbearance such that the forms include a reminder that there may be loan forgiveness options available and to direct borrowers to the Federal Student Aid website and FedLoan Servicing to learn more about PSLF.

Design new electronic forms that can be sent via e-mail to borrowers who express interest in PSLF.

Update its website and chat communications with borrowers, including by maintaining direct links to access the National Student Loan Data System (which contains authoritative information from the federal government concerning the PSLF program) on Navient’s website and ensuring that webchat conversations include leading questions asked of borrowers who possibly may be PSLF-eligible.

Maintain training and monitoring of call center representatives by providing education on the new practice enhancements and regularly monitoring sample calls to ensure compliance with new policies and procedures.

“The agreement is a good illustration of how borrowers and servicers can work together for the benefit of both parties,” AFT’s Weingarten stated. “It acknowledges that PSLF is a vital program for many graduates who forgo larger salaries in the corporate sector to serve the public instead.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden made an announcement in April that was mostly drowned out by more and more alarming developments of the coronavirus pandemic: As president, he would forgive undergraduate federal student loan debt picked up at public colleges for those earning less than $125,000 a year. Biden has also come out in favor of cancelling $10,000 of the debt for all borrowers. During the Democratic primaries, it was the more progressive candidates, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, calling for sweeping student loan forgiveness. Then the pandemic happened. Now, Biden joins a growing chorus of politicians and consumer advocates aware that Americans were already struggling with their student loans before the country fell into a recession, and that without deeper relief, millions of them will face financial ruin. Outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. has spilled to more than $1.6 trillion. Prior to the pandemic, some 1 in 7 borrowers were in delinquency, and up to two-thirds of people's monthly payments were just going toward the interest on their debt. In other words, their balances weren't going down.

These figures are practically guaranteed to worsen when the six-month reprieve Congress granted federal student loan borrowers from their bills comes to an end in September. Unemployment levels haven't been this high since the Great Depression. ""The student debt crisis was already at a tipping point and will be pushed over the edge by this pandemic,"" reads a recent report by the Brookings Institute. Thanks to the CARES Act passed in March, borrowers currently have until October before they need to resume payments. They're likely to get more time, experts say. ""There's serious discussions about extending that out,"" said Persis Yu, director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at the National Consumer Law Center.","Biden has also come out in favor of cancelling $10,000 of the debt for all borrowers.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has a much different take on My Education Solutions, alleging in a lawsuit that it charges what amounts to thousands in fees for loan-forgiveness services that are available for free elsewhere.

“Consumers end up paying more money on their student loans and face the possibility that their loans will not be forgiven at the end of the term due to MES’ deceptive practices, which include failing to pay the consumers’ student loans,” the suit alleges.

The state seeks more than $1 million in penalties, consumer reimbursements and attorney fees from MES and its CEO and president, Christina Randell. The action was filed Friday in state District Court.

The state also seeks injunctions preventing MES from destroying books and records, making any unauthorized withdrawals from consumers’ bank accounts and engaging in deceptive advertising, among other activities.

A call to Randell was not immediately returned Wednesday, and the attorney general’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment.

On ExpressNews.com: State settles with San Antonio man accused of selling counterfeit Yeti products

Randell previously operated Texas Debt Free Angels, a credit repair company. In 2014, it was issued a cease and desist letter from the Texas Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner for operating a debt-management service without registering with the state. MES also is required to register with the OCCC but has failed to do so, the suit says.

MES, which calls itself a “national consumer advocacy organization,” has received an “F” from the Better Business Bureau — the bureau’s lowest rating. The BBB also issued an alert, saying it was unable to substantiate several advertising claims about how much MES saved consumers. The BBB says information provided by MES showed that some consumers had “negative total savings on their student loans after enrolling” with MES.

In the lawsuit, Paxton targeted MES’ claim that consumers typically receive a 70 percent reduction in student loan debt.

“When asked how Randell arrived at that figure, she replied that it was calculated from her database and that some consumers could receive less than a 70% reduction,” the suit says. “Randell also claims that MES saved consumers over $100 million between October 2015-2016, but has no concrete proof to back that figure up.”

MES also told consumers there was no cost to enroll, but charged a $199 one-time enrollment fee and a $49 monthly “maintenance fee,” the suit says. Enrolling in the program will cost a consumer more than $6,000 in fees over 10 years, though some loans can take up to 25 years to pay back.

Repayment programs may be based on a consumer’s income, the suit says, so it’s possible a consumer may owe nothing for years. Yet MES will still charge a consumer the $49 maintenance fee to “submit” a “$0 payment,” the complaint adds.

The U.S Department of Education offers various programs to help borrowers with federal student loan debt, the lawsuit notes. They include the Teachers Loan Forgiveness Program and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Borrowers can apply through studentloan.gov and there are no fees, the suit says.

“Loan forgiveness eligibility requirements and payment levels under income-based repayment plans are set by federal law, therefore special deals cannot be negotiated or obtained by borrowers or debt relief companies,” the suit adds.

The lawsuit cites a consumer who paid a one-time fee of $99 to enroll in a loan forgiveness program. The consumer made three monthly payments of about $280 even though his first payment wasn’t yet due.

In addition, the suit says, MES did not pay the consumer’s loans on time, resulting in the account being marked delinquent by the loan servicer. The consumer later terminated his contract with MES, but the suit says it refused to refund the payments that were not applied to his loans.

Late payments may negatively affect consumers’ credit score, the suit says.

Another consumer, a teacher, says she discovered that MES had requested a forbearance on loan payments on at least three occasions — even though she never authorized them to do so. MES continued to take her money during that time, according to the lawsuit.

A former MES employee provided a printout to the attorney general’s office that indicated on one account a consumer had made 12 payments on his loan but only six of them were counted as part of the program he paid MES to enroll him in, the suit says.

The state is suing MES for violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, failing to register with the OCCC and misrepresenting the benefits of its services, among other claims.

MES has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit.

87,"Jun 15, 2020",Yahoo Finance,'Just not right': Defrauded for-profit college students suffer rejected relief claims,"This post has been updated with comment from the Education Department and clarifications on one student’s enrollment in ITT Tech.

The Education Department (ED) is rejecting borrower defense claims of defrauded victims of predatory for-profit colleges, according to letters and emails received by three applicants who told their stories to Yahoo Finance.

Three former students of the now-defunct ITT Tech told Yahoo Finance that their applications to have their student loan debt discharged under a “borrower defense” rule from the 1990s had been rejected.

The ED sent these people a letter saying that it had completed a review of the application and “determined that your application is ineligible for relief based on review of the facts of your claim and the regulatory criteria for relief… this decision means that your Direct Loans will not be discharged.”

Consumer advocates are dismayed by the decisions regarding ITT Tech, which maintained 130 locations across the U.S. before closing down in 2016.

“ITT was a predatory and fraudulent company… On every front and by every metric, ITT was a scam,” Toby Merrill, director of the Project on Predatory Lending, told Yahoo Finance. “The fact that the department is denying ITT students relief is unconscionable… it’s just not right.”

Merill, whose project represents 750,000 former ITT students, said that the for-profit chain created $6 billion in student loan debt between 2006 and 2016.

An ED spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that borrower defense claims “are not ‘approved’ or ‘denied.’ Borrowers are found to be eligible or ineligible for borrower defense relief. Though we can’t comment on these specific cases, each borrower defense application is adjudicated fairly and in a manner that assures that students who have suffered financial harm are provided relief.”

April 2020: ‘This is total bunk’

Joseph White, who attended an ITT Technical Institute in Missouri on-and-off from 2001 to 2008, ended up with an associate’s degree and $30,000 in student loan debt.

Story continues

After joining the military, White had attempted to pursue a bachelor's degree but said “hardly anybody would accept my ITT credits.”

He returned to ITT to finish his bachelor's degree. And during the second enrollment, he became disturbed by some of the ITT staff’s actions.

According to White, even though he had submitted state tuition assistance to be applied towards his tuition, the funds were “not accounted for, or missing” upon graduation. He also recalled being pressured to take out a private student loan, despite not wanting to hold them.

ITT’s career services department was also not much help while White was looking for a job. He said that they kept sending him job postings that looked like they were copied and pasted from a jobs site. Another former ITT student also reported the same experience.

White, who is currently trying to buy a home, is worried that the burden will be “overwhelming” between his mortgage payments and student loan repayments.

He had submitted a defense to repayment application in 2015, hoping to have his student loan debt discharged. His application was rejected on April 30.

“This is total bunk. … Most of these denials look like they are processed using a spam bot,” White told Yahoo Finance. “I’m utterly disgusted at the process. Dozens of other people who have been waiting for DTR responses have also been denied.”

DeVos under attack for borrower defense reversal

The so-called borrower defense rules were originally written into law through the Higher Education Act in the early 1990s and were meant to help victims of fraudulent schools seek relief.

Under existing law, borrowers with federal loans are eligible for loan forgiveness if a college or a university has misled them or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws.

After the Great Recession, enrollment at for-profit schools “skyrocketed in the first decade of the period, nearly quadrupling between 2000 and 2011,” according to the New York Fed.

In 2015, after several for-profit colleges went extinct amid scandals, the Obama administration implemented regulations such that defrauded students who made a successful claim would be granted full debt relief.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos modified that rule in 2019, making it tougher to access relief while alleging that the Obama administration had “weaponized” the regulations..

“When borrower defense arrived in 1995, it ... was little used… in the 20 years from 1995 to 2015, fewer than 60 claims were filed,” she said during a previous hearing in front of the House Committee on Education and Labor. “Then the previous administration weaponized the regulation against schools it simply didn’t like. They applied the law in a discriminatory fashion. So since 2015, there has been a 5,000% increase in borrower defense claims.”

A political spat ensued: Congress rejected DeVos’ new rules, tried to re-install Obama-era rules, which then passed the GOP-controlled Senate, only to be rejected by President Donald Trump.

The House has signaled that it would attempt to override the veto.

Meanwhile, DeVos has been the subject of multiple lawsuits on the issue as well, from consumer advocates, aside from lawmakers who decried her reversal.

May 2020: ‘A total shock’

Tammi Say, who was in her 40s when she had attended an ITT Tech in California, is carrying $26,000 in student loan debt.

After spending nine years in the military, Say became injured while driving trucks. She decided to attend ITT after seeing her brother successfully graduate from it.

But the experience, particularly with the financial aid office, was confusing.

“How much did I borrow? How many dollars in grants? I didn’t know any of that,” Say recalled. “They didn’t provide me receipts.”

After she left ITT, Say said she had filed for her debt to be discharged since she was disabled. After a few years, the debt was finally discharged, only to be reinstated by Sallie Mae around “the same time that ITT got bombarded by Obama and forced to close,” Say said. She is now a few months into a new disability discharge application with Nelnet.

Say submitted a borrower defense application, aside from the disability discharge, when “Obama was still president,” hoping to have her student loan debt discharged. Her application was rejected on May 20.

“It was a total shock that I got rejected, a total shock,” Say said.

June 2020: ‘I am so angry and disappointed’

Whitley Thompson attended an ITT Tech in South Carolina for five months and left without graduating in 2016. She owes $13,000 in student loan debt.

After graduating from high school, Thompson was working odd jobs when she saw an ad for ITT.

“They followed up with me constantly... and as the interview process went on, they were more than happy to get me signed up,” Thompson told Yahoo Finance.

In hindsight, Thompson noted, there were some actions ITT took that puzzled her. When she was taking out grants for the school, the school told her she needed a co-signer. When her dad, who was just out of jail, offered to be her co-signer, “they even let him sign for me,” she recalled. “That’s how desperate they were to get me in there.”

Thompson said that things got worse once she started school. “Some of the projects I had carried out were just complete garbage,” she said. Even though she was studying graphic design, she wasn’t even given access to Photoshop. She was pointed to a free website to download fonts, called DaFont, to practice.

“I had no idea that ITT was a for-profit college,” she said. “They never said that.”

After a few months, Thompson felt like there was nothing to gain from staying, so she quit. But she couldn’t walk away entirely: “I pretty much just got saddled with the debt.”

Thompson filed an application for debt relief in 2016 — which she said was like a “Rubik’s cube” and a “total mess” — hoping that she would receive at least partial relief on the debt she owed for a degree she didn’t even receive. Her application was rejected on June 9.

“They’re just shoveling them out the door,” she said. “I have tried really hard. We’ve paid off almost all of our medical debt, all of our consumer debt.”

Thompson worried about her child, bills, and medical expenses. She had to cross state lines for her daughter's medical appointments, traveling all the way to Charlotte, since she lived in a rural area.

“I am so angry and disappointed,” she said. “I feel like I made a mistake 10 years ago, going to that school, thinking that I was going to learn something and do something.”

88,"Jun 15, 2020",American Medical Association,Pandemic rekindles urgent need for medical student debt relief,"The AMA has long advocated for legislative action to ease the debt burden incurred by medical students. The demands of the COVID-19 pandemic pressed hundreds of fourth-year medical students into front-line service prior to graduation, where they have now been joined by the balance of their peers to help relieve the most challenging public health emergency of our lifetimes.

Featured updates: COVID-19 Track the evolving situation with the AMA's library of the most up-to-date resources from JAMA, CDC and WHO. Read the Latest

The time has come to extend a measure of relief to these and other medical professionals in the form of expanded student-loan forgiveness, tuition relief efforts, and increased funding for scholarships and grant programs.

The need is clear. More than three-fourths of all medical school students graduate with a median debt load of about $200,000 related to medical training, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The median level of medical student debt has roughly doubled over the past two decades, according to data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics.

For many medical school graduates, the ability to pay off these loans becomes even more challenging due to a number of factors. For example, medical students—like others pursuing advanced degrees—pay higher interest rates than undergrads. Also, interest begins accruing right away; there is no deferment of interest while schooling takes place, as occurs with many types of undergraduate student loans.

The AMA continues to enthusiastically back a broad range of initiatives designed to relieve the crushing burden of medical education and training debt. Several AMA-supported measures are now pending in Congress to achieve these goals, as outlined below:

We support provisions of the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month, which would provide an additional $30 billion for the loan-repayment and scholarship programs administered by the National Health Service Corps (NHSC).

This action would bolster the ranks of medical professionals in underserved communities nationwide, with a particular emphasis on communities of color that have historically lacked access to health care resources and have suffered higher rates of infection and death as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The HEROES Act would also boost annual funding of the NHSC from $310 million to $1 billion, with a corresponding increase in both scholarship and loan-forgiveness awards.

The AMA is also urging Congress to pass the Student Loan Forgiveness for Frontline Health Workers Act, (H.R. 6720), which would offer complete loan forgiveness to physicians, residents and medical students who are putting their own lives on the line to provide COVID-19 care.

Another measure pending in Congress that has drawn our support is the Rural America Health Corps Act (S. 2406), which would—among other provisions—provide up to five years of student-loan forgiveness for joining the NHSC, instead of the standard two years.

Related Coverage COVID-19: National Physician Town hall questions on residency

During this pandemic, and well after we have brought it to an end, the physicians and other medical professionals who have so selflessly risked their own lives, as well as the lives of their families and loved ones, should be able to focus solely on delivering the best possible medical care to the greatest number of people—as opposed to worrying about how they will repay the student loans that enabled them to deliver this care in the first place.

At the same time, the legislative remedies described here will also ameliorate the crisis of health care inequities across our nation by encouraging more physicians and other professionals to apply their expertise in both rural and underserved urban areas. This will have both an immediate and long-term impact in improving the health of our nation, which has been at the core of the AMA’s mission for more than 170 years.","The AMA has long advocated for legislative action to ease the debt burden incurred by medical students.

89,"Jun 14, 2020",Yahoo Finance,'Designed to fail’: Two public servants describe the government's troubled student loan forgiveness program,"Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF) in 2007 to help various kinds of public service workers erase their student debt after ten years of loan payments.

But management of the program is widely considered to be a failure as more than 98% of applications from teachers, firefighters, police, and other public servants are rejected.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been sued multiple times over her department’s high denial rate, while Education Department (ED) officials contend that Congress designed the rules to be too restrictive.

To better understand the PSLF process, Yahoo Finance spoke with two public servants who tried to use the PSLF program to get their student debt discharged.

‘It just seemed like it's designed to fail’

One is a tale of success through sheer will, while the other is a tale of disappointment.

“It was about the most confusing thing I've ever seen in my life, and I'm just being honest,” Ami Sandler, a California-based teacher, told Yahoo Finance. “It was the most tedious, most complicated thing I've ever seen.”

Gloria Nolan, who works at a nonprofit in Missouri, echoed the same sentiment. “It's been a very tedious process,” she told Yahoo Finance. “But I told you I was feisty. And I continue to continue to push and continue to try to seek the necessary answers.”

While both Nolan and Sandler had their original forgiveness applications rejected, Sandler ultimately ended up having $16,000 of his student loans discharged through a different public service forgiveness program after struggling with PSLF. Nolan, who still has $58,000 in student debt, is currently one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).

“It just seemed like it's designed to fail,” Sandler said of the PSLF program. “Honestly, it is. I feel like the system was designed to fail.”

As of April this year, approximately 150,000 borrowers applied for PSLF, the original program. Roughly 1.7% of applications were approved. The average discharged amount was $66,000.

Story continues

A big part of why so many applications were thrown out: The borrower had not made enough qualifying payments monthly — all 120 of them — or had missing information in their paperwork. Or, their loans weren’t actually eligible in the first place.

When Nolan found out about the program in 2008, she said she was told by her then-loan servicer that she “shouldn’t even be having this conversation” since she had to first make 120 payments to qualify for that program. Once she completed that, she recalled, the servicer promised to set up the loans forgiveness.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

Nolan began making those payments but found out after six years that she had been on the wrong payment plan and those payments wouldn’t count. She finally figured out the paperwork and worked with the servicer to enroll in the right payment plan and started all over again.

Nevertheless, her application was denied. Nolan then learned about Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF) — a congressionally-mandated expansion of PSLF that reduced some of the barriers — and applied for that.

Nolan's application was denied by the TEPSLF as well. And she isn’t alone: March 2020 data from ED revealed that 29,728 requests were made for TEPSLF and around 6% of requests were approved. The average balance discharged was $42,943.

Frustrated, Nolan decided to join the ATF lawsuit to compel ED to fix the system.

‘I felt betrayed’

Sandler went through a similar process. After finding out about PSLF and believing he qualified for forgiveness on his $53,000 in student debt, he formally applied for forgiveness in 2017 after ten years of making payments.

“You had to fill out paperwork to verify your employment — seemed pretty easy. You had to verify paperwork that showed that you still have loans — pretty simple,” Sandler recalled. “But then afterwards, after I had sent through the actual PSLF application for the first time, they emailed me back and said, ‘Oh, you sent us the wrong form. You’ll have to start over again.’”

He had apparently sent the wrong form for workplace verification, while the correct one from the federal government’s website was “no joke... 95% identical.”

“It was about one sentence difference — about 10 words — in the new form,” Sandler said.

When he finally filed his application, he continued, ED rejected it because he was technically on the wrong payment plan for more than a decade.

“I felt betrayed,” Sandler said. “I thought, wow, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.”

Sandler eventually found out about TEPSLF and applied for that since it only required 10 years of payments on any payment plan and 10 years of service.

So, he switched to another income-contingent payment plan and made a few more — and bigger — monthly payments (about $500 more) for 12 months and eventually saw his loans erased.

“All of your federal student loans serviced by FedLoan Servicing have been forgiven under the TEPSLF opportunity,” the email from FedLoan stated. “You no longer have a remaining balance with FedLoan Servicing.”

When he read the email, “I felt like I just lost 30 pounds, easy,” Sandler said. “It was just crazy and it felt so good .... it was $16,000.”

He stressed that the fine print was worth reading if people really wanted to get their applications approved.

“That's probably why 99% of people that are getting denied, because they don't know that they have to switch to an income-based plan because it's probably like the smallest font on the website about what you need to do,” Sandler said.

‘If the government wanted to help teachers...’

In early 2020, amid lawsuits against the department and lawmakers decrying that 99% rejection rate, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos agreed to simplify part of the paperwork process.

Before that announcement, the Trump administration had been headed the opposite direction: In his FY21 budget proposal, he stated his intention to sunset the PSLF program to save an estimated $1.9 billion over the course of the year.

In May, Democratic senators introduced a bill to amend the Higher Education Act and revamp the PSLF program to ease some of the convoluted rules that ED claimed was the cause of the high rejection rate.

The legislation offers a tiered forgiveness program. So instead of making 120 payments over 10 years, borrowers would get 15% of their balance forgiven after 2 years, another 15% of the balance after 4 years, and the entire balance after 10 years.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

In June, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed a lawsuit targeting the TEPSLF program, calling it “virtually inaccessible” with a “convoluted application process” for borrowers.

“There was nothing ever that was shared with me, as a borrower,” Sandler lamented. “If the government wanted to help teachers, you would've thought they would've sent something out to every educator that has a loan and said: ‘Here's something you may want to think about. Here's something you could possibly qualify for 10 years from now.’ And I would have done that 100%. I would have done that back then.”

When it comes to student debt, it seems you’re much worse off in Georgia than in Wyoming — according to LendingTree’s research team, those two states had the hardest and easiest times with student loans, respectively.

As the study findings suggest, where you live helps to determine where you can go with your student debt.

To find where loans pose the greatest burden, we ranked all 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) based on three key student debt metrics: the percent of residents with education debt, the median balance per borrower and the rate of delinquency (being late on monthly payments). Here’s what we discovered:

Key findings

Georgia was the first of three Southern states among the top five places with the biggest student debt problem. The Peach State ranked in the worst 15 for each of the metrics analyzed, including the second-highest median debt per borrower ($24,751), with only Maryland recording a higher average balance. (Read more)

The seven states with the smallest student debt problem were all located in the Western U.S., led by Wyoming. Just 19% of residents there have education debt, and their average balance checked in at a modest $17,017. Wyoming ranked in among the five best (i.e., lowest) in both of those categories. (Read more)

The story wasn’t so straightforward for some states. Minnesota, for example, reported the highest share of residents with student loans, with about 3 in 10 residents facing repayment — yet, on the other hand, a relatively low percentage (9.2%) of Minnesota’s student loan debt is delinquent. (Read more)

Where student debt weighs heaviest

Our study showed that Georgia is facing the heaviest difficulties on the student debt front. More than 1 in 4 state residents (27%) borrowed student loans for higher education, and they owe close to an average of $25,000 apiece.

To make matters worse, about 14% of these Georgia borrowers said they were 90 days or more late on their payments, putting them at risk of student loan default. That’s significantly higher than the approximately 11% of borrowers nationwide who are delinquent on their education debt by 90 days or more.

Ranking just below Georgia were…

2. Ohio: The Buckeye State was fourth in terms of the percentage of residents carrying student debt (at 30%) and sixth for median outstanding student loan balance (at $22,828). On the other hand, Ohio’s relatively low delinquency rate of 12.1% may have kept the state from outranking Georgia on the overall list.

3. South Carolina: The state registered the fourth-highest average student loan debt balance (at $23,813) and the seventh-highest delinquency rate (at 14%). One piece of good news: 25% of South Carolinians have student debt, placing it in the middle of the pack (25th) for that metric.

Not surprisingly, these three states also had heavy student loan debt levels at the city level: Atlanta; Akron, Ohio; and Charleston, S.C., comprised 3 of the 4 places with the most student debt in 2020.

States with a lighter student debt burden

At the other end of the scale, some states have a more favorable student loan situation, with the best being that of Wyoming.

Fewer than 1 in 5 residents (19%) here have student debt to fend off, and they owe just $17,017 on average. These numbers shine in comparison to the 69% of Class of 2019 graduates nationally who borrowed an average of $29,900 for their degrees.

Wyoming residents also appear better equipped to stay current on their loan repayment — more than 9 of every 10 borrowers in the state said their repayment was on track and they had avoided delinquency.

Rounding out the three states with the lightest student debt burden were Washington and Utah, each of which ranked 40th or below for all three of the metrics analyzed.

Washington state alumni seem to be relying less on borrowing as a means for covering their cost of attendance. Their residents’ median balance of $19,075 could be held down by the fact that four of its cities — Cheney, Olympia, Ellensburg and Bellingham — ranked among the best 20 cities for students working their way through college.

Location impacts on student loan repayment

Not all states share such a black-and-white story, of course. Minnesota, for example, was 10th overall, with a country-high 30% of its residents burdened with education debt. And yet, its delinquency rate (9%) ranked 39th highest, meaning that Minnesotans do a better job than most at avoiding late payments.

Likewise, Louisiana (15th overall) showed an exceptionally high share with delinquent student loan debt (15%), but the state was buoyed by its relatively low median student loan balance per borrower ($20,270).

Future and current borrowers likely face a repayment complicated by at least some of these factors. After all, location helps to determine the cost of a degree — and the cost of living — as well as the availability of postgraduate employment.

For future college students looking to avoid unnecessary debt, consider Student Loan Hero’s tips:

Deprioritize public schools with the most student borrowing : It’s common knowledge that private universities tend to cost more, but you might also look to avoid expensive public institutions, particularly if you’re an out-of-state student staring at an even higher price tag.

It’s common knowledge that private universities tend to cost more, but you might also look to avoid expensive public institutions, particularly if you’re an out-of-state student staring at an even higher price tag. Consider the most affordable small colleges : Smaller is, in fact, typically cheaper. Another popular and effective route to lowering the cost of your degree is to spend the first two years of your schooling at a local community college.

Exhaust every option before resorting to borrowing: Tapping into savings, taking on a summer job and aggressively pursuing scholarships and grants are all preferable to taking on debt. Unlike loans, scholarships and grants rarely need to be repaid.

Tapping into savings, taking on a summer job and aggressively pursuing scholarships and grants are all preferable to taking on debt. Unlike loans, scholarships and grants rarely need to be repaid. If you must borrow, do so strategically: Federal student loans are generally recommended over private student loans because they come with more expansive repayment options, such as access to income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs. Still, a private loan or an income-share agreement could supplement those funds if you hit your federal borrowing limits.

For borrowers already saddled with student debt, our advice includes considering relocation. By moving to another, more student-debt-friendly state, you could score one of more of the following benefits to your repayment:

Higher income

Lower cost of living

Tax advantages

Local debt repayment assistance programs.

With that said, excelling in repayment isn’t entirely dependent on where you live or work. You could reside in any state and still be able to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan to lower the monthly payments on your federal loans. Or you could look into refinancing your federal and/or private loans to lower your average interest rate.","Student Loan Hero is a completely free website 100% focused on helping student loan borrowers get the answers they need.

Right now, students and graduates have a cumulative total of $1.5 trillion in student loans. Nearly 30 million Americans under the age of 39 are struggling to repay their debt. With the average borrower owing more than $30,000, repaying student loan debt can be intimidating, if not impossible, for some.

If you’re struggling to repay your student loans, you’re not alone. Nearly 11 percent of all student loans are 90 days or more past due, and more than 20 percent of borrowers have fallen behind, to some degree, on their student loan payments.

Several options could make repaying your federal or private student loans a little easier:

1. Consolidate or refinance your student loan

One way to help ease the financial burden of your student loan is to consider a student loan consolidation or a refinance. Both options could (and should) reduce your monthly payment and/or the total cost of your loan.

If you have a federal student loan, consolidating your loans could help lower your monthly payments, potentially reduce the rates on at least some of your loans, and allow you to maintain the benefits of having a federal loan. A loan consolidation takes all of your student loans and combines them into one loan.

Alternatively, you could refinance your student loan. A refinance would allow you to take advantage of low-interest rates. If you lower your interest rate by at least one percent, a refinance could be a cost-effective option and a long-term solution. Don’t forget to visit Credible to research rates from different private student loan companies to ensure you save as much money as possible.

3 THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE BORROWING FOR COLLEGE

However, it's important to note that you cannot refinance into a federal loan, so if you choose to refinance your federal student loans, you’d have to work with a private lender. It’s also important to note that both a refinance and debt consolidation consider your income and credit history for qualification.

Use a tool like Credible to find your personalized rates and make sure you’re saving as much money as possible.

2. Adjust your loan repayment plan

Sometimes a few adjustments to your current plan could make a huge difference. If your payment date conflicts with your rent or other large payment, consider talking to your lender to change the date your payment is due.

If you need more help, there are a few plans that could be worth looking into. Still, most of these options apply only to federal student loans. If you have private student loans, talk with your lender for more information.

Income-driven repayment plans: Federal student loans could qualify for one of four different plans including:

The Revised Pay as You Earn Repayment Plan (REPAYE)

Pay as You Earn Repayment Plan (PAYE)

Income-based Repayment Plan (IBR)

Income-Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR)

Each of these plans bases your monthly payment on your income. The first three listed determine your payment using 10 percent of your discretionary income. The ICR plan uses 20 percent of your discretionary income. All plans last between 20 and 25 years.

You can use the Federal Loan Simulator to estimate your monthly payment under such a plan.

HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST STUDENT LOAN REFINANCING OFFER

Economic Hardship Deferment: If you are unable to make any student loan payments, you may qualify for an economic deferment. If you use an economic hardship deferment, in conjunction with an income-driven plan, any remaining balance owed at the end of the payment period goes away.

Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness Plan: Borrowers who work full-time for the government or a non-profit organization could have their student loans forgiven. Borrowers must repay their loans under an income-driven plan and make at least 120 qualifying payments.

Interest-only repayment: Private lenders may allow you to make interest-only payments. Some students make these payments to avoid accruing interest while attending school. You may also qualify for an interest-only repayment if you have financial difficulties.

3. Cut unnecessary expenses

Whether you qualify for one of the above options or not, you can make repaying your student loans a little easier by reducing costs. You could save a significant amount of money each month by lowering these expenditures:

Cell phone bill

Internet and cable expenses

Streaming services

Grocery bill

Car insurance

Dining out

Housing

Taxes

Entertainment

Utilities

THIS IS WHY STUDENT LOAN REFINANCING RATES ARE GOING DOWN

It is rare for student loans to be completely wiped out through bankruptcy. If you are unable to make payments, your best option is to talk with your lender. They can work with you. Avoiding payments could result in a lawsuit, garnished wages, the loss of tax refunds, and/or social security benefits. Additionally, your lender (federal or private) will report delinquencies to credit reporting agencies.","If you’re struggling to repay your student loans, you’re not alone.

92,"un 10, 2020",The CPA Journal,Navigating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program,"In Brief

In an attempt to alleviate the burden of student debt on U.S. borrowers, the federal government offers a Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, by which eligible individuals can have the balance of their loans forgiven if they meet certain requirements. Despite being in existence for over 10 years, the program has only approved about 1% of the applications it has received. The author provides an overview of the program, explaining the eligibility requirements and covering recent and possible future developments. *** Under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, borrowers of eligible Federal Direct Loans who have made 120 monthly payments under a qualifying student loan repayment plan while employed in a full-time public service job may have the balance of the principal and interest due on the loans forgiven. Loan forgiveness under the PSLF program is exempt from federal taxation [Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 108(f)]. Under the current portfolio of federal student loan debt, 42.2 million individuals hold $1.4811 trillion dollars of federal student loans (“Federal Student Aid Portfolio Summary,” Federal Student Aid website, https://bit.ly/3euguf6). It is estimated that nearly one-fourth of all jobs could qualify for the PSLF program (“Federal Student Loans: Education Could Do More to Help Ensure Borrowers Are Aware of Repayment and Forgiveness Options,” U.S. Government Accountability Office GAO-15-663, Aug. 24, 2015, https://bit.ly/3csfiHz); as shown in Exhibit 1, however, as of June 30, 2019, only 1,216 of the 102,051 processed applicants (1.19%) had received forgiveness under the PSLF program since it began accepting applicants in October 2017 (“June 2019 PSLF Report,” Federal Student Aid website, https://bit.ly/3eqWpXg). Exhibit 1 PSLF Applicant Statistics as of June 30, 2019 If so many borrowers qualify for the program, why have so few received forgiveness? The answer is complicated. Some suggested reasons include the newness of the program, lack of borrower education, and issues concerning the administration by the Department of Education (DOE) and loan servicers contracted by DOE. In short, however, the majority of borrowers submitting applications for forgiveness have failed to satisfy PSLF program requirements. Accordingly, this article reviews the PSLF program for individuals eligible for or currently participating in the program as part of a financial plan. Topics covered include the administration of the PSLF program, its requirements, and its future in light of expected costs and recent attempts to eliminate the program entirely.

Administration of the PSLF Program Congress established the PSLF program under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRA). Specifically, the CCRA amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to create the PSLF program. The PSLF program encourages borrowers to enter and remain in public service jobs by offering them student loan forgiveness in exchange for doing so. Oversight of the PSLF program rests with the DOE, which oversees the issuance of Federal Direct Loans but has hired contractors to service those loans (GAO 2015). All contracted servicers have minimum responsibilities for educating borrowers about the PSLF program; however, the DOE has contracted with a single servicer, FedLoan Servicing, to administer the PSLF program (GAO 2015). To receive loan forgiveness under the PSLF program, borrowers must complete and file the DOE’s PSLF Application for Forgiveness upon completion of PSLF program requirements. FedLoan Servicing then reviews and forwards successful applicants to DOE for final review. If the DOE determines the borrower has met all PSLF requirements, it directs FedLoan Servicing to forgive the balance of the principal and interest due on the borrower’s qualifying loans (GAO 2015) Borrowers need not wait until making all 120 payments to determine their status under the PSLF program. They may submit the DOE’s Employment Certification Form (ECF) to FedLoan Servicing to verify PSLF employment and qualifying payments. Submission of an ECF is recommended, but not a condition, for loan forgiveness under the PSLF program. When a borrower submits an ECF for the first time, FedLoan Servicing determines whether the borrower has a qualifying employer and qualifying loans. If the borrower meets these qualifications, the borrower’s DOE-based loans, including federal loans ineligible for PSLF, are transferred to FedLoan Servicing. Thereafter, FedLoan Servicing determines the number of previous payments made by the borrower that are eligible for the PSLF program (GAO 2015).

Qualifying Student Loans The PSLF program only applies to Federal Direct Loans. Thus, loans that are not Federal Direct Loans do not directly qualify for the PSLF program. This includes student loans issued under other federal programs and student loans issued from private lenders such as banks. Federal Direct Loans are loans issued under the U.S. Department of Education’s William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. The Direct Loan Program provides government loans directly to borrowers without the use of private lenders and, since July 1, 2010, represents the primary federal student loan program. Eligible Federal Direct Loans include those shown in Exhibit 2. Exhibit 2 Federal Direct Loans Eligible for the PSLF Program Borrowers holding federal student loans ineligible for the PSLF program may consolidate the loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan. This allows borrowers not immediately qualifying for the PSLF program to obtain a Federal Direct Loan. Loans eligible for consolidation include Federal Family Education (FFEL) Loans, Federal Perkins Loans, Health Education Assistance (HEAL) Loans, and other Federal Direct Loans (“Direct Loan Consolidation,” Federal Student Aid web-site, https://bit.ly/2VxxNDA). Private loans are not eligible for consolidation. Direct Consolidation Loans are convenient because they provide for a single monthly payment; however, this is not without PSLF drawbacks. Under the consolidation process, a single, consolidated loan is issued, from which the proceeds are used to satisfy balances of the loans subject to consolidation. Thus, PSLF payments made prior to the consolidation process do not count toward the 120-payment requirement. Instead, borrowers of Direct Consolidation Loans must restart PSLF payment progress (“PSLF Program,” Federal Student Aid website, https://bit.ly/2XGodRi).

Qualifying Repayment Plans To qualify for the PSLF program, borrowers must make payments under a qualifying repayment plan. Qualifying repayment plans include those under 1) an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan; 2) a standard 10-year repayment plan; and 3) a standard, graduated, or extended repayment plan, to the extent monthly payments under the plan equal or exceeding the standard 10-year repayment plan, as measured from when the loan entered repayment [HEA section 455(m)(1)(A)]. IDR is an umbrella term for repayment plans under which monthly payments are a percentage of the borrower’s discretionary income (“Income-Driven Repayment Plans,” Federal Student Aid website, https://bit.ly/3evpfWC). IDR plans include the following: Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)

Income-Based Repayment (IBR)

Pay As You Earn (PAYE)

Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE). IDR plans generally provide the lowest monthly payment and therefore the greatest PSLF benefits (“PSLF Help Tool,” Federal Student Aid website, https://bit.ly/2xyXdst); this is shown in Exhibit 3. Borrowers, however, must qualify for, and elect to enroll within, an IDR plan. Absent these measures, repayment on a Federal Direct Loan defaults to a standard repayment plan, which is not based on income and can yield significantly fewer PSLF benefits. Exhibit 3 Modeling of the PSLF Program* As shown in Exhibit 4, IDR plans base monthly payments on a percentage of a borrower’s discretionary income. Discretionary income equals the extent to which a borrower’s federal adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds a percentage of the Department of Health and Human Services’ federal poverty guidelines for the borrower’s family size. In this framework, the PAYE and IBR for post–July 1, 2014 borrowers’ plans generally provide for the lowest monthly payments. Exhibit 4 IDR Repayment Plans* The standard 10-year repayment plan also represents an eligible repayment plan [HEA section 455(m)(1)(A)(ii)]. This plan, however, is structured to repay the entire loan over the 10-year period. Thus, a borrower making all 120 payments through a standard 10-year repayment plan would have no remaining balance to be forgiven under the PSLF program. Finally, PSLF eligible repayment plans include a standard, graduated, or extended repayment plan to the extent monthly payments under the plan equal or exceed the standard 10-year repayment plan, as measured from when the loan entered repayment [HEA section 455(m)(1)(A)(iii)]. For example, certain extended or graduated repayment plans have monthly payments that increase over the payback period such that they may exceed the standard 10-year repayment plan. By and large, however, payments under these plans will not meet the eligibility criteria necessary for the PSLF program. In March 2018, Congress provided for temporary expanded public service loan forgiveness to aid borrowers denied under the PSLF program for having made nonqualifying payments under certain standard, graduated or extended payment plans. Much like under the PSLF program, borrowers have found limited success in this opportunity. Regardless of participation in an IDR, standard, graduated, or extended repayment plan, the borrower must make 120 qualifying payments. This does not, however, mean all 120 payments must be made under a single, qualifying repayment plan [“Master Promissory Note,” Federal Student Aid website, https://bit.ly/2RHWQCM]. For example, suppose a borrower makes qualifying payments under a standard 10-year repayment plan and then switches to an IDR plan. Assuming the majority of the 120 payments come from an IDR plan, the initial payments count toward the 120-payment requirement. Thus, borrowers switching plans generally do not lose prior payments made under a qualifying, but different, repayment plan.

120 Monthly Payments To qualify for the PSLF program, borrowers must have made 120 qualifying payments on or after October 7, 2007 [HEA section 455(m)(1)(A)]. A qualifying payment is on time, required, for the full amount due, while employed in a full-time public service job, and made under a qualifying repayment plan. The borrower must make 120 qualifying payments; however, the payments need not be consecutive. If a borrower makes payments while working for a qualifying employer, leaves for a non-qualifying employer, and then returns to a qualifying employer, all payments made while working for a qualifying employer count toward the 120 payments requirement. In addition, a qualifying payment must be on time and required. A payment is on time if it is made within 15 days of the scheduled due date. A payment is required if the borrower is in repayment status on a loan. Accordingly, payments made while a borrower is in deferment, a grace period, or forbearance do not count toward the 120-payment requirement. Finally, a qualifying payment must be for the full amount due. The full amount due is determined by the repayment plan in which the borrower participates and is generally reflected on the billing statement provided by the loan servicer. If the borrower has multiple loans, the billing statement may provide for a single payment amount reflective of the cumulative value of the full amount due under each loan (“About Payments,” Navient website, https://bit.ly/2Vbhmhb). Borrowers who pay less than the full amount due have not made a full payment (Alexandra Hegji, “The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program: Selected Issues,” Congressional Research Service Report, Oct. 29, 2018, https://bit.ly/2XE4wcT). If the borrower has multiple loans, a payment for less than the full amount due is applied in proportion to the current amount due for each loan. For example, if a borrower has a monthly payment of $500, reflecting five loans each with a $100 full amount due, and makes a $400 payment, then one-fifth of the payment ($80) is applied to each loan. In this case, the borrower has not paid the full amount due for any loan. Borrowers with multiple loans who pay less than the full amount due can, however, specify an alternative payment application. Using the same facts, a borrower may request the $400 payment be applied evenly to four loans, leaving one loan unpaid for $100. Thus, the payment for the month with respect to the specified loans is considered for the full amount due. Borrowers who pay more than the full amount due also face PSLF challenges. First, borrowers can only receive credit for one payment per month. Borrowers making a lump sum payment equivalent to multiple future month payments or making multiple payments per month have not expedited the PSLF process. Generally, the most efficient route to loan forgiveness under the PSLF program requires 120 payments be made over a 10-year period. Second, to the extent a monthly payment exceeds the full amount due, an overpayment is applied to the next month’s payment. Depending on the amount of overpayment, the next due date on the loan could be extended a month or more into the future; this is known as being “paid ahead.” Payments made while in paid-ahead status do not count toward the PSLF program. Paid-ahead status can be challenging when, as an employment incentive, an employer makes a lump sum payment on a borrower’s loans. Not only does the lump sum payment count as a single payment, thereby reducing the effective value of the payment to the employee, but it may also cause the borrower to enter paid-ahead status, thus extending the time necessary to receive loan forgiveness under the PSLF program. The HEA and PSLF regulations do not provide quantitive measures for determining the public service necessary to render a private not-for-profit organization PSLF eligible. To avoid some of the issues of paid-ahead status, borrowers can request a specific overpayment be applied to the principal of the loan instead of a future month’s payments, or request their loan servicer remove the ability to enter paid-ahead status.

Employment in a Public Service Job To qualify for the PSLF program, borrowers must be employed in a full-time public service job during the period in which the borrower makes each of the 120 qualifying payments and at the time of loan forgiveness [HEA section 455(m)(1)(B)]. Being employed means being hired and paid; volunteer hours are ineligible [34 CFR section 685.219(b)]. Likewise, being employed by a nonqualifying employer that contracts with or provides services to a public service organization is ineligible. Full-time employment is generally defined as working in a qualified job for the greater of 1) an annual average of at least 30 hours per week, or, for a contractual period of at least eight months, an average of 30 hours per week; or (2) the number of hours the employer considers full-time [34 CFR section 685.219(b)]. Vacation time or qualifying leave time under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 are not considered in this calculation [34 CFR section 685.219(b)]. Furthermore, borrowers working part-time in different public service jobs may generally aggregate work hours to meet the full-time employment standard. The HEA defines a “public service job” as a full-time job in emergency management, government, military service, public safety, law enforcement, public health (including nurses and professionals engaged in healthcare practitioner and support occupations), public education, social work in a public child or family service agency, public interest law services, early childhood education, public service for individuals with disabilities or the elderly, public or school-based library sciences, or an IRC section 501(c)(3) organization that is exempt from taxation under IRC section 501(a). Under IRC section 501(c)(3), a tax-exempt organization is one organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes; to foster national or international amateur sports competition; or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals. Such an organization cannot have any part of net earnings benefit a private shareholder or individual. Furthermore, a tax-exempt organization is substantially limited in its lobbying and cannot participate in political campaign activities. Exhibit 5 provides examples of careers potentially eligible for the PSLF program. Exhibit 5 Examples of Careers Potentially Eligible for the PSLF Program Interestingly, PSLF regulations also define a “public service job” to include certain private not-for-profit organizations that provide a public service [34 CFR section 685.219(b)]. Such organizations generally include all of the job categories used in the HEA definition of a public service job; however, such organizations cannot be organized for a profit, cannot be a labor union or partisan political organization, and cannot be engaged in religious activities, unless the activities are unrelated to religious instruction or worship services. The HEA and PSLF regulations do not provide quantitative measures for determining the public service necessary to render a private not-for-profit organization PSLF eligible. Instead, the ECF and the PSLF Application for Forgiveness state that the “primary purpose” of a private not-for-profit organization must be to provide a public service. Because “primary purpose” is not defined, borrowers employed by private non-for-profit organizations may be uncertain as to whether they are eligible for the PSLF program. Hypothetically, a borrower in this situation could submit an ECF to FedLoan Servicing to determine employer eligibility. Recent developments, however, have tested the reliability of ECF determinations made by FedLoan Servicing. In December 2016, the American Bar Association (ABA) sued the DOE, alleging mismanagement of the PSLF program [American Bar Association v. U.S. Department of Education, 1:16-cv-02476 (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia)]. Under the facts of the suit, FedLoan Servicing, through ECF review, recognized the ABA as a qualifying employer for purposes of the PSLF program. Thereafter, however, the DOE retroactively revoked this determination, alleging the ECF represents “provisional guidance” and reserving the ultimate right to determine PSLF employer eligibility. Ultimately, the district court found that the DOE improperly changed the terms of the PSLF program and ruled in favor of the ABA. At the time of this writing, the DOE has restored loan payment credits to affected individuals and does not plan to appeal the ruling (“ABA Encouraged by Recent Developments in Public Service Loan Forgiveness Lawsuit,” ABA website, Aug. 26, 2019, https://bit.ly/34IpKIo). Nevertheless, the case calls into question the management of the PSLF program and the credibility assigned to FedLoan Servicing ECF determinations.","Accordingly, this article reviews the PSLF program for individuals eligible for or currently participating in the program as part of a financial plan.

“Our work with Savi comes at a critical and challenging time. Many employees of nonprofit and government entities carry student loan debt and are either unaware of or confused when navigating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program,” said Rob Scheinerman, Chief Executive Officer of AIG Retirement Services. “We understand the long-term impact student loan debt can have on financial and retirement security, which is why we are proud to be working with Savi to help employers empower their workforce to take control of their student loan debt. The new program can chart the path for nonprofit and public service employees to loan forgiveness, helping to improve their financial future and creating enhanced flexibility around other goals, including saving for retirement.”

The current environment threatens to exacerbate what was already a large challenge. The Federal Reserve estimates that the nation’s collective student loan debt is $1.6 trillion,1 and the Congressional Budget Office projects an average of $100 billion each year in new federal student loan debt for the next five years.2 More than one in six American adults carry a federal student loan,3 and the average federal student loan borrower carries over $35,000 in debt.4

This problem is particularly acute for the 34 million government and nonprofit employees,5 some of whom may be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a federal program that eliminates all remaining federal student debt after 120 months of qualifying payments have been made.6 To date, the program has experienced high rejection rates for applicants, with less than two percent of applications being approved as of April 30, 2020.7 For many, this is due to incomplete applications and lack of understanding of program requirements.

AIG Retirement Services and Savi seek to improve and simplify the experience for public service employees by providing an end-to-end digital process that helps:

- determine qualification for student loan forgiveness

- identify potential savings

- navigate through enrollment

- maintain eligibility

- provide a clear path to applying for full forgiveness

For employees of nonprofit and public sector AIG Retirement Services clients that are offering the new student debt solution, this unique technology will be available on their employer’s retirement plan website. This service also provides Savi’s analysis of government rules concerning student loan debt, including new provisions in the CARES Act.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is suing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over a roundly criticized loan forgiveness program designed for public service workers.

The lawsuit alleges that the Education Department (ED) is “flouting Congress’s clear and repeated instructions to provide student loan debt relief to public servants” and making loan forgiveness “virtually inaccessible” through a “convoluted application process” for these borrowers.

“College graduates who put in a decade of hard work and made timely payments on their student loans earned their [temporary public service] loan forgiveness,” Attorney General Becerra said in a statement. “But Education Secretary Betsy DeVos chose to ignore all of that. Today's lawsuit reminds Secretary DeVos that she is not above the law.”

Becerra added that DeVos “is accountable to these college graduates who followed the rules and deserve better, especially amidst an economic crisis of historic proportions.”

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, this “mismanagement” of the loan forgiveness programs to public servants “is shameful and illegal,” the lawsuit stated.

In response to the lawsuit, U.S. Department of Education Press Secretary Angela Morabito argued that the loan forgiveness program was problematic because it was poorly designed by Congress and blasted Becerra.

“This is yet another political stunt by an activist state attorney general hoping to curry favor with left-wing activists,” Morabito said in a statement provided to Yahoo Finance. “We have said it before, and we’ll say it again: The PSLF program needs a permanent fix. When the PSLF program was written more than a decade ago, the Department provided technical assistance to Congress and made Congress aware that only a small fraction of borrowers would qualify because of the way they wrote the law.”

With regards to the temporary expanded program, she added: “The Temporary Expanded PSLF opportunity didn’t fix any of these problems. The Department must implement laws as they were written by Congress.”

PSLF, TEPSLF explained

Story continues

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program was created in 2007 by Congress to encourage students to enter public service jobs, such as teaching, firefighting, law enforcement, public defenders, family and child services employees, and some medical workers.

The promise made for undertaking such jobs would be that after they made 120 on-time loan payments (or 10 years’ worth), they’d have the remaining balance forgiven.

In 2017, when the first wave of applicants actually applied for the forgiveness, and they were denied en masse — ED was reported to have denied 99% of all applicants. One of those applicants, Kelly Finlaw, an art teacher in New York City, spoke about her experience in a Yahoo Finance podcast.

Congress gave ED an opportunity to fix the situation in 2018, creating a secondary program called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF).

But two years later, ED continues to have a 94% rejection rate.

March 2020 data from ED reveals that 29,728 requests were made for TEPSLF, and around 6% of requests were approved. The average balance discharged was $42,943.

As of April this year, approximately 150,000 borrowers applied for PSLF, the original program. Roughly 1.7% of applications were approved. The average discharged amount was $66,000.

The lack of implementation, the lawsuit states, means that DeVos and ED have violated the Administrative Protective Act by failing to implement TEPSLF.

Despite many applicants completing the necessary requirements to qualify for the forgiveness, “nearly all of them have had their applications denied.”

The lawsuits keep coming

DeVos has faced a number of lawsuits since taking the helm of the department.

On this issue of loan forgiveness, aside from Becerra, the American Federation of Teachers has also filed a lawsuit on the PSLF’s shortfalls.

At the same time, this is also not Becerra’s first legal action against one of the longest-serving cabinet members of the Trump administration.

In March this year, he sued the department for “illegally rescinding” a 2014 rule called “gainful employment” that was designed to protect students against predatory educational institutions.

Becerra had also previously sued DeVos in 2017 — along with 18 other attorneys general — alleging that she illegally delayed the implementation of the 2014 rule.

The California AG had also sued in August last year after DeVos revised a mechanism that defrauded students of predatory institutions could rely on for debt relief.

Congress passed a resolution to reset back to Obama-era rules, overriding DeVos, but President Trump vetoed the rollback legislation.

Earlier in the day President Trump met with members of the Senate GOP.

California is suing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the U.S. Department of Education for what the state alleges is a failure to implement its student loan forgiveness program for people who took on public-service jobs.

""Today's lawsuit reminds Secretary DeVos that she is not above the law,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Wednesday.

""She is accountable to these college graduates who followed the rules and deserve better, especially amidst an economic crisis of historic proportions.""

DeVos has been a lightning rod in the education world and in Washington. Her critics have highlighted her multimillion-dollar wealth and connections to various industries, and pointed to her family's previous donations to Republican efforts. Consumer advocates have also said she's made it harder for defrauded students to get their loans canceled.

Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program in 2007 to encourage students to take public service jobs, like education and firefighting, by promising forgiveness of the remaining balance of their federal student loans after a decade of on-time payments. In 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated that one-quarter of American workers could be eligible.

Yet a complicated loan system and misinformation by lenders led to many borrowers hitting walls. Ninety-nine percent of loan forgiveness applications under that program were rejected between May 2018 and May 2019.

In 2018, Congress set aside hundreds of millions of dollars to fix the troubled program. The temporary expansion aimed to deliver forgiveness to borrowers who hadn't been told by their lender or didn't understand that they were enrolled in a payment plan that disqualified them.

In the lawsuit, Becerra said the Education Department continues to deny almost all borrowers who apply for debt forgiveness under the program. California, the most populous state in the country, is home to the sprawling University of California system, which boasts 280,000 students and 2 million alumni living worldwide. There are over 700 colleges in California, overall, and the state accounts for 10% of the nation's college enrollment, more than any other state.

""College graduates who put in a decade of hard work and made timely payments on their student loans earned their TEPSLF loan forgiveness. But Education Secretary Betsy DeVos chose to ignore all of that,"" said Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration more than 80 times.

The Education Department has received more than 196,000 applications for public service loan forgiveness and has approved just around 3,400, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

The Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","California is suing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the U.S. Department of Education for what the state alleges is a failure to implement its student loan forgiveness program for people who took on public-service jobs.

97,"un 3, 2020",KATC,Scammers trying to take advantage of student loan suit,"A new scam has arisen, following the settlement of a student loan forgiveness lawsuit.

Navient has more than 10 million student loan clients and recently settled the suit. The results of the settlement won’t affect what individual borrowers owe. However, scammers were quick to notice this news item and are now targeting borrowers with false claims of debt forgiveness – for a fee.

The Better Business Bureau officers this information about the scam:

How the Scam Works

You receive a call from a person claiming to represent Navient. They explain that as a part of the lawsuit settlement, your student debt is partially or completely forgiven. Of course, you’ll need to confirm your personal information and pay a fee to “transfer” the debt from Navient to “the Department of Education” or another official-sounding organization. These claims are based on actual procedures you may in fact qualify for, but this unsolicited caller is not working in an official capacity or related to any of the organizations cited in the call.

The caller explains the fees necessary, usually on a monthly basis, then request either debit or credit card information. Then, they will begin making withdrawals according to the payment plan you agreed to. Many consumers notice something is wrong when their Navient loan payment continues to be required, even after setting up payments with the new company.

Navient customers will not receive a phone call offering to transfer your loan. If you engage with these con artist callers, you could compromise your personal information and lose money as well. Instead, look for other options such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness [studentaid.gov] and Department of Education [ed.gov] for deferral or other information in relation to your type of loan.

How to Avoid the Scam

98,"un 3, 2020",Los Angeles Times,Wall Street halts massive student-loan relief deal in court,"A federal judge sided with a coalition of financial firms, rejecting an agreement between U.S. regulators and a money manager that could have brought student-debt relief to hundreds of thousands of borrowers.

U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika in Wilmington, Del., denied on Sunday the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s proposed 2017 settlement with a group of 15 investment vehicles known as the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts. Noreika determined that lawyers hired to act on the trusts’ behalf lacked authority to deal with the consumer bureau, according to an opinion unsealed Wednesday. The trustee, Wilmington Trust, had the authority but it declined to agree to the proposed settlement.

The agreement promised to audit some 800,000 student loans to resolve allegations that collection agencies illegally flooded the nation’s courts with faulty paperwork to force distressed borrowers to pay up. Some borrowers defeated collection attempts by convincing judges that the trusts couldn’t prove the debts were valid, prompting expectations that the audit meant debt forgiveness for many was around the corner.

Banks, insurers, debt collectors and hedge funds involved in the trusts’ operations tried to block the accord. They argued that Florida-based VCG Securities, which holds equity slices of the National Collegiate trusts, had no right to hammer out the agreement with the federal consumer bureau. Donald Uderitz, who runs VCG, didn’t respond to an email, text message and voicemail seeking comment. Marisol Garibay, a spokesperson for the consumer bureau, declined to comment.

Hundreds of thousands of borrowers collectively owe billions of dollar to the trusts, which are among the nation’s largest owners of private student debt. The loans, made more than a decade ago, have ranked among the worst-performing student loans ever packaged into securities. Of the original $12 billion in loan principal bundled into the trusts, nearly half was in default at the time of the 2017 settlement.

Uderitz has tried for years to change how the trusts collect from borrowers. One idea involved purchasing loans, taking a cut, and then striking deals with borrowers who’d pay less than what they owed. Uderitz has been unable to convince other investors in the trusts that he’s acting in their best interests.

Money managers Angelo Gordon & Co., Waterfall Asset Management, One William Street and Libremax Capital — which collectively hold more than $1.8 billion in notes issued by the National Collegiate trusts — have fought Uderitz in federal and state courts. Their lawyer, Michael Hanin, a partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, said the consumer bureau’s deal with the trusts would have trampled their rights.","Noreika determined that lawyers hired to act on the trusts’ behalf lacked authority to deal with the consumer bureau, according to an opinion unsealed Wednesday.

99,"un 3, 2020",Washington Monthly,Why Are Student Loan Borrowers Being Kept Out of the Coronavirus Recovery?,"The student debt crisis is about to get a whole lot worse. Republicans are refusing to help.

The novel coronavirus outbreak has overwhelmed the country’s health care system, caused widespread unemployment and furloughs, and shut down major parts of the economy, leaving federal and state lawmakers scrambling to support millions of Americans and small businesses.

Even from the outset of the pandemic, it was clear that the ensuing tumult would exacerbate the nation’s pre-existing economic woes and inequities. Low-income workers in the hospitality, retail, and restaurant industries were more likely to lose their jobs. African American and Latino communities have been more susceptible to infection.

Democrats in Congress quickly recognized that this new reality would also impact the millions of student loan borrowers. Already, more than 45 million Americans are still paying off their student loans—accumulating a total of more than $1.6 trillion of outstanding debt. That’s largely due to the rapidly increasing price of higher education. Over the last 20 years, college costs have grown at three times the rate of inflation. The average borrower owes more than $37,000 by the time they graduate.

Meanwhile, there’s been a growing mismatch between the skills employers are looking for and the ones newly minted college graduates have cultivated, making it harder for them to get jobs with which they can pay off their debt.

A global pandemic that has shattered the economy will make that task even more challenging.

That’s why Democrats in March put forward a series of proposals to forgive large portions of student debt as part of the first coronavirus recovery package. House Democrats wanted to forgive $30,000 per borrower (which was never realistic) while Senate Democrats presented a plan to forgive $10,000 across the board. The House plan applied only to public loans, while the Senate proposal authorized the Department of Education to make payments on behalf of borrowers with all loan types.

But the ideas were quickly shot down by Republicans. Instead, the $2.2 billion aid package, known as the CARES Act, suspended interest, payments, and involuntary collection for all federal loan borrowers until September 30. That doesn’t cover every borrower, though; it excludes those with Federal Family Education Loans and Perkins Loans, meaning eight million borrowers still owe monthly payments on their federal student loans.

“I’m sure everybody could use more money,” South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said on Fox News, when asked about the student debt forgiveness proposals. “But I don’t want to give money to people who have a paycheck. I want to give money to people who have lost their jobs. What the hell has that got to do with the virus?”

Turns out, quite a bit.

The trillions of dollars in student loan debt has widespread effects on borrowers and the economy in normal circumstances. Those with outstanding debt struggle financially while putting off savings, retirement, and major life decisions, like buying a home.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who proposed loan forgiveness even before the pandemic, have said that erasing some of the burden will reduce the wealth gap in America and enable young people to start families and purchase houses. Moody’s has further said that such a move would boost household consumption and investment; improve business formation; and increase home ownership in the long run.

“Student debt cancellation would actually be a boost to the economy,” said Cody Hounanian, the policy director for the advocacy group Student Debt Crisis. In effect, it would free up millions of Americans to stop funneling huge chunks of their earnings into paying off their loans and instead spend that money on buying things and starting businesses and families. “We’re hoping that student debt cancellation will help mitigate what looks like could likely be a pandemic induced recession in the very near future,” Hounanian added.

In other words, the COVID-19 crisis is likely to leave millions of Americans struggling to pay off student loan debt even deeper in the hole. A national forbearance on payments and interest doesn’t solve that issue, it only prolongs it.

“If you’re just suspending payments and waiving interest, then you’re not actually doing anything about the core of the problem,” said Ashley Harrington, the federal advocacy director of the Center for Responsibly Lending (CRL). “Even if you’re not making a monthly payment [you still feel] the effects of student debt on your access to credit, on your mental health, or your job prospects. Student loan borrowers are going to come out of this crisis worse off.”

Americans agree. According to a May 12 Chesapeake Beach Consulting poll commissioned by CRL, more than 60 percent of Americans support permanently reducing student loan debt by $20,000 during the coronavirus crisis. Roughly 78 percent of Democrats support such loan relief, as do roughly 49 percent of Republicans.

That may be a positive sign. The coronavirus outbreak has already gotten Republicans to recognize the importance of a number of social programs and liberal ideas, such as free testing, stimulus checks, and other benefits allotted to Americans in need. Increasingly, GOP voters may start to recognize the hindrance student loan debt has been to letting young people start their lives, especially if it begins to affect them personally.

That, in turn, could result in those voters putting more pressure on their elected representatives. In fact, it already has: In late April, Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York put forward a bill that would extend CARES Act protections to the borrowers left out of the original bill. Still, the GOP is far from where it needs to be. The party remains adamantly resistant to any form of loan relief.

After two failed pandemic-related attempts to address debt relief in Congress—first in the CARES Act, then in the second stimulus package, the HEROES Act—House Democrats are trying again.

On May 12, they proposed a measure to include $10,000 in student loan relief for borrowers who were “economically distressed” before the pandemic hit, meaning they made less than they owed before President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, and extend the suspension of payments to September 2021. Originally, the lawmakers wanted all borrowers to get the $10,000 debt forgiveness, but they balked after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that would have cost $250-300 billion, more than Democrats initially expected.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, however, recently said he supports $10,000 in loan relief across the board and proposed a $750 billion student loan plan focused on income-driven repayment if he’s elected. He also called for full debt relief for borrowers who graduate from a public college or university and whose family earns less than $125,000 per year.

Even $10,000 in universal relief would make a significant impact. Approximately 40 percent of U.S. borrowers would have all their loans canceled, according to a CRL analysis. Of all the borrowers who are currently delinquent or in default, 78 percent would then have less than $40,000 in debt left.

The bill, which passed the House on May 15 and is now awaiting a Senate vote, is expected to meet sharp resistance from Senate Republicans and the White House. But if Trump and the GOP are serious about wanting to restart the economy, a significant step would be to remove the single biggest barrier keeping millions of Americans from engaging in economic activity.

“Student debt cancellation is connected to an increase in GDP,” Hounanian said. “It’s also connected to an increase in jobs, something that’s so important right now when we see unemployment rates skyrocketing.”

Forgiving student loan debt may be expensive. It will surely cost the government in the short term, but it may also save our economy in the long term. That’s a price worth paying.","Democrats in Congress quickly recognized that this new reality would also impact the millions of student loan borrowers.

In this season of virtual graduations, disappointing teleconference congratulations, and looming financial pressures, it seems particularly timely to give new graduates a sense of what their student loan obligations might be in the coming months.

On March 27, President Donald Trump signed the CARES Act into law. This act was intended to provide fast economic assistance in the form of stimulus checks and other financial relief options to help American taxpayers face the unprecedented struggles associated with the global health crisis brought on by COVID-19.





[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]

While there has been a wealth of information about the economic relief provided to small businesses and taxpayers, guidance on the ways the CARES Act provides relief to student loan borrowers has been less clear.

First, and perhaps most critical for new graduates, is that there will be no payments expected from March 13 through Sept. 30 for federal student loan borrowers. During this period, the interest rates on these loans will be set at 0 percent. Payments should automatically stop at this time for people whose loans were in repayment.

If auto-debit payments have been made during this time, borrowers may contact their loan servicer to ensure their loans meet the criteria and to request a retroactive administrative forbearance. This will provide you with a refund of payments made and back-date your forbearance to the March date. Direct Loans, FFEL Loans, Perkins Loans and HEAL Loans, and other federally backed loans will likely qualify whether they were in default or good standing.

There is little incentive to continue payments during this financially stressful time, which may give some graduates reason to hope. For instance, if a graduate is enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) plan and on a qualifying repayment plan prior to the March forbearance date, and worked full-time for a qualifying employer during the forbearance, they should expect to receive credit toward PSLF for the period of payment suspension as though they made on-time monthly payments.

However, for Maine graduates who are taking part in the Opportunity Maine Tax Credit (OMTC), continued payments may be necessary in order to continue to qualify for the tax credit. Because the automatic temporary forbearance of loan payments is optional, graduates may elect to opt out in order to continue to qualify for the OMTC. Graduates who do not opt out of this relief will have their loans placed in administrative forbearance and will show an amount due of $0. This will make any payments ineligible for the tax credit. Questions regarding the OMTC should be directed to the Maine Revenue Services.

Another key point of the CARES Act is that negative credit reporting for eligible federal student loans will be temporarily suspended. This may seem like a ridiculous time to worry about a credit score, but the economy and our job prospects will rebound. Credit scores affect our ability to secure the most basic and important things: mortgage rates, credit card approvals, apartment requests or even a new job.

A moratorium on negative reports means if graduates in repayment are experiencing financial difficulty and miss any of their payments, the Department of Education will report missed payments as though they were made on time. Credit scores will be protected. Equifax, TransUnion and Experian, the three major credit bureaus, are participating and are offering free weekly online credit reports through April 2021 so that student borrowers and all consumers can keep track of their financial future. It is important to remember that this applies specifically to federal student loans.

Graduates all over the country are struggling to understand their options and make their payments during the coronavirus pandemic. If you have questions about your payments, income-driven repayment plans, recertifications for PSFL or OMTC, Mainers can contact the Student Loan Ombudsman in the Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection.

102,"May 29, 2020",The New York Times,"Over Veterans’ Protests, Trump Vetoes Measure to Block Student Loan Rules","WASHINGTON — President Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution on Friday to overturn new regulations that significantly tighten access to federal student loan forgiveness, siding with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over veterans’ organizations that say her rules will harm veterans bilked by unscrupulous for-profit colleges.

The veto will allow stringent rules for students seeking loan forgiveness to take effect on July 1. The rules toughen standards established under the Obama administration for student borrowers seeking to prove their colleges defrauded them and to have their federal loans erased. Even if some borrowers can show they were victims of unscrupulous universities, they could be denied relief unless they can prove their earnings have been adversely affected.

The resolution “sought to reimpose an Obama-era regulation that defined educational fraud so broadly that it threatened to paralyze the nation’s system of higher education,” Mr. Trump said in his veto statement. “The Department of Education’s rule strikes a better balance, protecting students’ rights to recover from schools that defraud them while foreclosing frivolous lawsuits.” It was the president’s eighth veto.

According to a 2018 report from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), graduate-level nursing students said they expected to leave their program with a median debt of $40,000 to $54,999. And the National Student Nurses’ Association found small percentages of ADN RNs and BSN RNs with as much as $80,000 in student debt.

If you’re a nursing student dealing with debt like this, you may consider refinancing your student loans. Refinancing your student loans essentially means getting a new loan at a new (hopefully lower) interest rate. For nurses who have high interest rates, or loans from multiple lenders, consolidating their loans and refinancing into a new, lower interest rate can save them a lot of money, and cut years off the time it takes to pay them back. This article will explain what refinancing your loans means, the best way to do it, and how it could benefit you.

What is Student Loan Refinancing?

Student Loan Refinancing is obtaining a new loan at a new (lower) interest rate. Private student loans can be refinanced with a new loaner or the same one. Federal student loans are often paid off by a private loan.

Student loan refinancing at a lower interest rate has MANY benefits including:

Lower monthly payments

The ability to repay student loans faster

A decreased debt-to-income ratio

The ability to pause payments

Simplified management of student loans

Should You Consider Refinancing Your Student Loans?

Refinancing student loans is a great option for those looking to save thousands of dollars and fit the eligibility criteria. Refinancing private student loans comes with little downside, but refinancing federal student loans does have potential downsides. Individuals would be giving up income-driven repayment plans, loan deferment, and loan forgiveness benefits. Also, if you refinance a federal student loan and it becomes a private student loan, you will not qualify for any benefits the government gives towards student debt.

Refinancing is often a good option when interest rates are significantly lower than the original interest rate on your student loan. Now is a VERY good time because interest rates are low due to COVID-19, but whether or not it is a good time depends on your specific situation. Ultimately, not everyone can qualify to refinance their student loans. If you meet the above requirements, consider refinancing.

To refinance or not to refinance?

Refinancing is a good option if you: Refinancing is not a good option if you: Can lower your interest rate to a point where you’d receive substantial savings each month

Can pay back your loans faster

Have private student loans

Have student loans with high variable rates

Have improved your finances since you obtained your loan Have federal loans

Have a drop in income or unsteady income

Are pursuing student loan forgiveness

Have recently or plan to declare bankruptcy

Have recently defaulted on student debt

What Qualifications Do I Need in Order to Refinance?

Lenders will look at a few factors to determine whether or not you’re a good candidate for loan refinancing. These include:

1. Credit Score

Lenders will first look at your credit score to determine your financial responsibility. By evaluating your credit score, lenders are able to determine if you will be able to meet your financial obligations and if you have a history of on-time payment. Some lenders will require a minimum credit score of at least 600 while others do not have a minimum. Financial advisors recommend a credit score of at least 700 to maximize the chances of approval.

Co-Signers Can Help Your Chances if You Have Bad Credit

Don’t have a great credit score and unsure if you will qualify? Lenders will allow a co-signer to the new loan, but this individual must have a solid credit score. It’s important to remember that this person will be responsible for payments if you default or are not able to pay. Most will have their parents or spouse co-sign if possible, but this can also affect their credit score.

If having a co-signer is not a possibility – it is best to increase your credit score before refinancing. You can do this by paying down your credit card debt, making sure your payments are on time, and increasing your salary if possible. Increasing a credit score can take some time, so this also might not be a possibility if you're trying to capture low-interest rates right now.

2. Debt-to-Income Ratio

Your debt-to-income ratio is very important to lenders because it lets them know what percentage of income goes towards bills. This is one of the first things a lender will look at along with your credit score.

Essentially, they divide your total monthly payments by how much you earn each month. Generally, lenders want the debt-to-income ratio to be under 50%.

3. Employment

Lenders also want to see that you have a steady job and/or consistent income to show that you can continually make payments without issue. Some will require proof of income and you should be able to prove you have savings to pay at least two months of regular expenses, including housing.

4. Degree Completion

Student loan refinancing is generally only available to those that have completed their degree program. Some will ask for specifics regarding your degree and graduation. While graduating isn’t always required, it does dramatically reduce the student loan refinancing options and you won’t be eligible with as many lenders.

How to Refinance Your Student Loans

Determine if you are eligible and refinancing is right for you Shop around to find the best interest rates on private student loans (these generally will be the same but some banks will offer incentives) Contact multiple lenders to get interest rate estimates Speak with lenders to find the best fit and ask all your questions Choose a lender and loan terms Complete an application for student loan refinancing Sign all documents and appropriate paperwork Wait for loan payoff check Pay off other student loans (federal or private) with loan payoff check

As the debate over extending student loan forgiveness continues in Congress, college students are taking on increasing amounts of debt. Typically, 7 in 10 college seniors graduate in the red, owing about $30,000 per borrower, according to data from the Institute for College Access & Success. Going forward, a 2020 high school graduate could face $37,200 in loans in pursuit of a degree at a public college or university, according to a new NerdWallet analysis of data from the National Center for Education Statistics.

The report factors in that it now takes five years, on average, to complete a four-year bachelor's degree, given that more undergraduates will take at least some time off. At the same time, college costs are rising. Tuition and fees plus room and board for a four-year private college averaged $49,870 in the 2019-20 school year; at four-year, in-state public colleges, it was $21,950, according to the College Board. In addition, dramatic market swings have taken a toll on college savings account balances. Total 529-plan assets fell to $293 billion in March after hitting an all-time high of $328 billion in December, according to Morningstar's annual report.

For-profit colleges stole our past 10 years. But Trump has the chance to make it right.

When we met in 2007, we were on our way to achieving the American dream, and we were doing it together.

We were students at the now-closed Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in Florida. Thirteen years and some 25 student loans later, our dreams of marriage, a family and home ownership have been deferred by our overwhelming student loan debt. And dreams for students like us may be dashed altogether unless President Donald Trump signs into law a bill passed by Congress in March that would rescue us and 200,000 other students who got ripped off by shady for-profit schools feasting off government student loans.

For-profit colleges looking to deceive

Our story is familiar to many victims of predatory lending and fraudulent practices of colleges that take advantage of students. Those abusive practices led to several school closures — including the Art Institutes, a franchise of for-profit colleges once operated by Education Management Corp. (EDMC)

EDMC was so bad, it paid a nearly $200 million settlement in 2015 related to aggressive recruiting practices aimed at vulnerable students, including veterans and working parents, with promises of a degree and then saddled them with debt — and very little to show for it.

The limits of free speech: Twitter and Trump on a collision course with the truth

Eventually, dozens of Art Institutes closed permanently, and EDMC went bankrupt in 2018. Unfortunately, students like us have hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and useless degrees. All that time, effort and money to get an education to prepare for a career that could give us the life we wanted, and it’s all worthless.

We wish we could pay back all of our loans and we had an education that was worth something. We don’t want a handout. We want justice and we finally got it — almost.

Betsy DeVos cracks down on relief

Congress passed a bill that would allow borrowers like us to get loan relief from the worst of the predatory colleges. There’s only one problem: Congress’ bipartisan bill overturns a borrower defense rule put forth by the president's own Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

You see, borrower defense is a policy that provides relief to borrowers who used federal student loans to attend predatory colleges by canceling that debt. It is supposed to help students like us who were scammed with promises of good jobs and a high-quality education but left with worthless degrees and staggering debt.

But in 2019, DeVos used her executive power to rewrite the rule in a way that would make it almost impossible for defrauded students to get relief. Under her rewrite, only 3% of federal student loans associated with fraudulent and illegal conduct by institutions would be forgiven, according to an analysis by The Institute for College Access & Success. And there would be virtually no accountability for the for-profit companies that prey on students.

Accountability is what we want and deserve. The president gets the final vote on this — sign the law that Congress passed, or veto it and protect the scammers and his Education secretary.

Life and career put on hold

We’ve been engaged for 11 years but don't feel like we can move forward because of debt. We graduated from the Art Institute — in 2009 and in 2011 — with initial loan balances of $62,000 and $72,000. Because of steep interest rates, those loans ballooned, and our student loan debt is now roughly $224,000 combined, even after paying off one of our high-interest private loans.

We graduated with degrees in illustration and film and video production, but we’re not working in our chosen field. We couldn’t find jobs that paid enough to cover our bills. Our combined annual household income is $57,000, but without income-driven repayment options, our debt payments alone would have totaled more than $25,000 every year.

Coronavirus heroes: I thought Filipino nurses were 'sellouts.' I was wrong.

Had we received the quality education and job placement assistance the school promised, it would be a different story. The school’s recruiters promised us a 90% job-placement rate, great connections, and starting annual salaries between $30,000 and $40,000. All of that was a scam.

Thanks to a federal lawsuit we joined, DeVos and her department have to process backlogged student loan forgiveness claims. And Congress has done its part to make things right by voting across party lines to repeal DeVos’ changes to the borrower defense rule. Now it’s President Trump’s turn to show his support for students and working people harmed by predatory colleges, by signing this resolution into law.

We want justice and accountability. The school should be held accountable for its broken promises and what this has done to students and young people like us.

107,"May 27, 2020",Mic,Will coronavirus cancel my student debt?,"Earlier this month, the House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act, legislation that will provide financial aid to states, some industries, and notably, those with student debt. The bill, which is fully dubbed the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, builds on the previously passed CARES Act in a few areas. But the possibility that coronavirus could cancel some student debt may be the most notable, as Whitney Barkley-Denney, the senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, tells Mic that there are 44 million borrowers with student debt living in the United States.

Borrowers in their 20s and 30s in particular are uniquely primed for economic hardship in addition to stress caused by the pandemic: Older millennials graduated into the Great Recession and a fraught housing market, while the youngest millennials, now a couple of years out of college, are trying to break into their chosen fields during a global pandemic. Under the House's version of the HEROES Act, many of these people would experience some sort of debt relief while they try to navigate the crisis.

What is the HEROES Act?

The HEROES Act, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey (N.Y.), is a $3 trillion legislative package slated as a follow-up round of funding to the $2 trillion CARES Act, which was passed in late March. The CARES Act included some provisions to help borrowers with federal loans, but the HEROES Act goes a step further to assist some private borrowers as well.

The HEROES Act provides funding to a number of governing bodies — states, local governments, tribal nations — to help alleviate the costs of the pandemic. Many states have dug into their emergency funds to fund unemployment programs and social safety nets, or to expand essential services, and federal funding will help them to continue to provide these services.

So what does the HEROES Act do for student debt?

A large portion of the credit for furthering the national conversation on student debt forgiveness can be attributed to former presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Both senators made some level of forgiveness foundational to their presidential campaigns; in Sanders's case, the forgiveness was universal, while Warren called for a progressive system with a cap for the highest earners.

The HEROES Act expands on the CARES Act's loan forgiveness in three ways: instituting loan forgiveness of $10,000 for some borrowers, changing the timetable for borrowers under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and extending pauses on loan payments, explains Dominique Baker, an assistant professor of education policy at Southern Methodist University.

The first area of loan forgiveness — $10,000 of relief — only applies to borrowers with federal or Perkins loans, or a Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) that is privately held and not actually serviced by the federal government. However, of this group of borrowers, only those considered to be ""economically distressed"" qualify for the $10,000, says Barkley-Denney. Those who were already paying 0% on their loans or were in default, delinquency, forbearance, or deferment before the coronavirus pandemic started will be able to have up to $10,000 of their debt forgiven.

Part of the trickiness of the FFEL loans in particular, Baker explains to Mic, is that the federal government took on loans that used to be handled by private entities during the first term of the Obama administration. Because of this, she says, borrowers will have to look into what kind of loan they have if received an FFEL loan before the program's end in 2010. If they have an FFEL loan, they're eligible to consolidate their loans, but consolidation doesn't automatically mean that you'll get a lower interest rate.

The HEROES Act would also expand the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, Baker says. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, those who qualified for public service loan forgiveness could have their debt forgiven after 10 years of repayment from when they qualified for the program. If you have a federal loan (or what's called a Direct Loan), you're eligible to apply for a PSLF loan, but you must be employed by a governing body or not-for-profit organization and meet four other requirements. But that also means that if someone paid their debt for five years while working in the private sector and then applied for PSLF, they would ultimately make payments for 15 years, because the payments made under the PSLF program would only count when they started the public service job.

Under the HEROES Act, though, these PSLF borrowers would have the option to consolidate their loans, and have their prior years of repayment count toward the overall 10 years. In other words, the proposal is ""giving you credit for the time spent paying the loan,"" Baker says.

The last change the HEROES Act makes for student loan borrowers is extending the time period of authorized nonpayment of debt. This means that a borrower wouldn't have to start paying back or resuming loan payments until Sept. 30, 2021, extended from the Sept. 30, 2020 date originally established by the CARES Act. Barkley-Denney says that while the halt on payments would help all those who qualify for forgiveness, it would disproportionately assist those with the greatest ability to pay off the principle of their debt (that is, the amount before interest). This is because they can continue to chip away at the debt itself while there's 0% interest, as opposed to lower income ""struggling"" borrowers who ""aren't even touching principles"" in the first place because so much interest has accrued, Barkley-Denney explains.

Going forward, Barkley-Denney says, Congress should focus on automatically qualifying lower-income borrowers for income-driven repayment programs that would make ""sure that they're in payment plans that fit their budget."" Adjusting the terms of the loan to better suit a borrower's income status is an effective way of ensuring that they'll be able to pay off the loan without defaulting, even if it happens over a longer period of time, and also without cornering low-income borrowers into choosing between affording loan payments and other expenses.

Who qualifies for HEROES Act student loan forgiveness?

The CARES Act left out about 9 million borrowers, and the HEROES Act takes a step in addressing these people, Barkley-Denney says. Yet those who have debt held by private companies, like banks and other ""commercial"" agencies, still aren't covered by this legislation.

Moreover, the $10,000 forgiveness would only apply to the most cash-strapped borrowers, and the funds would only pay as much debt is owed. So if you have $7,000 in Direct Loan debt, you don't get to keep the extra $3,000.

Still, forgiving $10,000 of debt for the borrowers who owe the least amount of money would likely have a broad impact, Baker tells Mic, because 34% of those with student debt owe $10,000 or less. These borrowers are also the least likely to be able to pay that debt back, as a significant portion of them might have started a four-year academic program without finishing them, thus accruing the debt without completing the degree that may have enabled them to find higher-earning job opportunities.

Will the HEROES Act pass the Senate?

The term that's getting thrown around is ""dead-on-arrival,"" which basically means House Democrats and political wonks don't believe that the legislation stands a chance of getting passed by the GOP-controlled Senate. Or, they worry, on the off-chance that the legislation is approved, it might be stripped of many of the benefits included in the House's version first. For instance, early drafts of the CARES Act discussed providing a $2,000 check to adults, or consistent monthly payments, and both ideas were shot down by Senate Republicans. (The legislation ultimately included a one-time check of up to $1,200 for certain Americans.)

Democrats in the Senate will argue that what the House Democrats propose in the HEROES Act is both necessary — and already a compromise. While Republicans don't want to increase the national debt, Democrats say they're concerned with the longevity and severity of our current economic crisis, and that assisting student borrowers will help them stay solvent during the pandemic and help the national economic recovery.

Whether or not the HEROES Act passes is dependent on whether legislators want to make an investment now for future economic prosperity, Baker says. Forgiving debt during the pandemic would allow a borrower to focus on other areas of financial concern.

But despite the reluctance of Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to pass this legislation, Barkley-Denney points to a Center for Responsible Lending poll that shows that most Americans are in favor of $20,000 across-the-board loan forgiveness. That's 63% of voters in all regions of the country who believe in permanently reducing debt.

If it will happen actually happen, well, that's another question entirely.","But the possibility that coronavirus could cancel some student debt may be the most notable, as Whitney Barkley-Denney, the senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, tells Mic that there are 44 million borrowers with student debt living in the United States.

Between the wounds to the economy inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic and a growing sense that there's something broken with how the U.S. finances higher education, plans to deliver relief to borrowers are mounting.

Among the approximately 43 million student-loan borrowers in the U.S., almost 60% owe $20,000 or less, while about 25% owe $40,000 or more, according to Education Department data. Borrowers who graduated with bachelor’s degrees in 2018 left school owing an average of about $29,000, according to the College Board.

So is this a crisis that calls for a cancellation of all federal student debt, as championed by former Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren? Or are there less-drastic ways to help those struggling to pay off their loans?

Proponents of mass debt cancellation say it is the appropriate response because failed government policies, not recklessness on the part of students, led to an explosion in borrowing. Opponents point to high repayment rates as evidence that the student-loan program is working, and question the wisdom of forgiving the debt of wealthier students and those with advanced degrees.

Suzanne Kahn, deputy director of the Great Democracy Initiative and Education Program at the Roosevelt Institute, makes the case for debt cancellation. Jason Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, argues against it.

YES: The government made this crisis. The government should solve it.

By Suzanne Kahn

Today’s student-loan crisis is weighing down the entire U.S. economy.

Americans hold a collective $1.6 trillion in federal and private student loans, and the effects of that debt on recent college graduates has been well documented: delayed homebuying, marriage and wealth formation. But college loans also are eating into the retirement savings of older Americans, who hold increasing amounts of such debt, taken on for their own education and that of their children. Overall, student loans now account for 35% of the most severely delinquent household debt.

In the face of these stark numbers, it is time to cancel all federal student loans.

Cancellation is the appropriate response because this is a crisis of the government’s making. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, states cut public funding to higher education, leaving individuals to pick up the slack. Tuition at public four-year colleges increased 36% between 2008 and 2018. And as many young people turned to higher education to wait out a weak job market, increased demand pushed up tuition costs at private schools, as well.

Readily available federal loans, rather than expanded grants, helped students meet rising costs. This might have worked out if the returns on a college education had climbed at a similar rate. Instead, since the recession ended, wages for college graduates have stayed flat. One 2018 analysis from Brookings predicts that nearly 40% of borrowers who entered college in 2004—and thus graduated into a depressed job market during the recession—may default on their loans by 2023.

Total federal student debt outstanding In deferment In forbearance In default

Among those most hurt by rising costs and stagnating wages have been Black students, who are more likely to have to borrow to go to college and face a discriminatory job market when they graduate. Research shows that 12 years after entering college, the average black borrower still owes more than he or she borrowed.

To address mounting concerns about borrowers’ distress, the federal government created repayment programs that tie monthly payments to borrowers’ incomes. The complexity of these programs have led many to experience the sudden addition of unpaid interest to loan balances or be outright denied forgiveness. Nevertheless, almost 45% of federal loans are now being paid through such programs. That isn’t evidence of success but rather a clear sign that borrowing hasn’t paid off for many. These programs are the main reason the average monthly student-loan payment has remained stable relative to income over the years.

Canceling student debt would be an important acknowledgment of the consequences of a failed policy. Moreover, it would boost the economy.

Before the current Covid-19 crisis, research from the Levy Economics Institute found that canceling all student debt could boost real GDP between $86 billion and $108 billion a year for 10 years and lower the unemployment rate between 0.22 to 0.36 percentage point over the decade.

Some ask why Americans who didn’t go to college should help pay the debts of those who did. As long as student debt is serving as a drag on our economy, everyone is paying for it, and the country can no longer afford not to act.

Debt cancellation alone isn’t enough to ensure this crisis won’t repeat itself. To bring down student-debt levels permanently, we need to pair a one-time cancellation with free, public higher education. (Federal student loans might continue to exist as an option to protect students who need to borrow for living expenses or who choose private education from predatory, private lenders). Done together, free college and student-debt cancellation policies would signal that the decision to place the onus for financing higher education on individuals was a mistake.

Canceling student debt will benefit the economy as a whole, narrow racial inequalities and begin to correct the policy mistakes that have limited an entire generation’s ability to build wealth.

NO: The student-loan program isn’t perfect, but it works

By Jason Delisle

Calls for the federal government to forgive outstanding student debt are grounded in the belief that most borrowers face long-term hardship from these debts. But if that truly were the case, one would expect advocates for mass loan forgiveness to also call for an end to the student-loan program. Yet most would have the government make new loans even after the current stock of debt is forgiven.

This is a major inconsistency in the argument for large-scale loan forgiveness, and it illustrates why the case for forgiving all debt is quite weak.

The government’s student-loan program isn’t perfect but on the whole it works. It ensures widespread access to higher education at affordable repayment terms and the vast majority of loans are fully repaid.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports that about 80% of borrowers pay off their student loans within 12 years of entering repayment. Others take longer, especially when economic crises like the coronavirus outbreak occur, but flexible repayment terms help them stay afloat and repay when the economy recovers. And while it’s true that a subset of borrowers—mainly those who attend community colleges and for-profit institutions—have high default rates, their balances tend to be relatively small (about $7,000) and are often fully repaid despite the default.

Budget statistics also reflect that overall payments remain high. Unpaid debts cost taxpayers $4 billion per $100 billion in loans made annually. That loss pales in comparison to the cost of forgiving all debt.

Of course, loan payments can still be overly burdensome for some borrowers. Here again, however, the evidence isn’t consistent with a permanent and widespread affordability crisis.

A recent study by the JP Morgan Chase Institute of four million families’ financial records finds that the typical monthly student-loan payment ranges from $144 to $203. Data collected by the Federal Reserve show a similar figure. And student-loan payments tend to take up less than 6% of a borrower’s earnings, an amount that has been remarkably stable since the mid-1990s, as documented in a 2014 Brookings Institution study. As such, it is hard to imagine that student loans are preventing family formation or home buying on a large scale.

The idea that loan forgiveness is needed to boost the economy is similarly questionable. Yes, putting cash in families’ pockets might goose short-term economic growth, but why target student debt? Many households carry mortgages, auto loans and credit-card debt.

Student debt might be better suited for mass forgiveness if only low- and middle-income families held it. But among first-year undergraduates, students from families earning over $114,000 are just as likely to borrow as the lowest-income students—and they take out loans twice as large. That isn’t surprising since financial-aid policies have spared many low- and middle-income students from college-tuition price hikes. The result is that high-income students would be major beneficiaries of loan forgiveness, as would the countless lawyers, doctors and others with advanced degrees who account for 42% of all student debt.

None of this is to say that all borrowers can afford to repay all of the time, especially in times of crisis. But temporary economic shocks can be addressed with temporary solutions, such as the recent coronavirus-relief package that waives student-loan payments and interest for six months.

And for borrowers who need longer-term relief, there are programs such as Income-Based Repayment, which allows those with federal loans to pay a small share of their income no matter how much they owe, and then qualify to have remaining balances forgiven after 20 years.

This program should be improved to help borrowers who are struggling the most, rather than forgive everyone’s debt regardless of whether they really need the help.

And it’s here where inaction -- on the bill, which was passed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representative -- so far fails the health care workers and first responders (law enforcement officers, firefighters, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians) it is designed, in part, to help. But just how is the $3 trillion HEROES Act planning to benefit the front-line fighters? Part of the bill includes a $200 billion Heroes’ fund “to ensure that essential workers who have risked their lives working during the pandemic receive hazard pay.” I have skin in this game. My daughter is a registered nurse whose job, in part, includes taking the temperature of anyone coming to the emergency room at the hospital where she works. So you can be darn sure I’m keeping an eye on the HEROES Act for my hero, and other health care workers and first responders. Here’s some of what the HEROES Act offers them.

Bonus Pay for Health Care Workers, First Responders Health care workers and first responders, including police and firefighters among essential workers, would be eligible for $13-per-hour pay bumps up to $10,000 (on top of their regular salary) as part of the HEROES Act. The pay would be retroactive to January 27, when the COVID-19 public health emergency was declared, until 60 days after the end of the emergency. The employer would apply for the grants from the federal government to cover the pandemic premium pay for essential workers. The employees would see a separate line item on their paycheck showing this pandemic premium pay. Your boss would not be allowed to reduce any other pay or benefits because of this. The retroactive pandemic premium pay would come in a lump sum soon after your employer gets the grant. Oh, and yes: it would be taxable.

Child Care Assistance for Health Care and Emergency Services Workers Included in the HEROES Act is $850 million going to the states to assist essential workers, including health care workers and emergency response workers, for child and adult care help, beginning January 21 of this year. Individual states would decide how the extra funding works; they could directly pay child care (as well as adult care) providers or reimburse workers directly if they pay for care themselves.

More Health Care Jobs with Student Loan Payoffs Looking for a job in the healthcare industry without the unbearable weight of student loans? The HEROES Act has a path. Included in the bill is the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program, structured to “assure an adequate supply of and encourage recruitment of public health professionals to eliminate critical public health workforce shortages in local, state, territorial, and tribal public health agencies.” Participants in the program must be accepted into an accredited educational institution or in the final semester of a program leading to a public health degree (health professions degree or certificate or a degree in computer science, information science, information systems, information technology or statistics). Once they accept employment with a public health agency and sign a contract to work there for two years or more, the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program will pay off their student loans up to $35,000 per year of contracted service. Bonus: Those who have worked in the public health workforce for the last 10 years are also eligible to have their student loans paid off through the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program.

Disability (and Death) Benefits for Public Safety Officers Included in the HEROES Act are disability and death benefits for public safety officers affected by COVID-19 while on active duty. Benefits would apply to public safety officers diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020, until one year after the coronavirus emergency period is declared over.

Aid for Firefighters through FEMA The HEROES Act includes $1.3 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to prevent, prepare for and respond to the coronavirus. Included in that is $500 million to purchase personal protective equipment and related supplies, mental health evaluations, training and decontamination or sanitizing facilities and equipment for firefighters. There’s also $500 million for hiring and retaining firefighters.

Funding for Police Officers The HEROES Act includes $300 million for the purchase of personal protective equipment for law enforcement, as well as for the hiring or rehiring additional career law enforcement officers.

Tax Deduction for First Responders Under the HEROES Act, first responders would be able to take a $500 “above-the-line” tax deduction for unreimbursed expenses for tuition and fees related to professional development or training, or for the cost of uniforms. An ""above-the-line"" deduction means a deduction you can claim even if you don't itemize.","But just how is the $3 trillion HEROES Act planning to benefit the front-line fighters?

112,"May 19, 2020",Vox,"The stimulus law’s student loan payment freezes, explained","One of the less-discussed benefits in the CARES Act is assistance for those with federal student loans. But unlike other programs in the stimulus legislation, no application is required.

The law doesn’t cancel student debt, but it does freeze payments — and their interest — for everyone who has a federally held loan. Most borrowers won’t have to worry about making any loan payments until October — for now.

A number of lawmakers don’t think the law goes far enough. The HEROES Act — a $3 trillion fourth congressional stimulus package — passed by the House of Representatives Friday, would forgive up to $10,000 of both federal and private loans for borrowers meeting the criteria to be deemed “economically distressed.” The provision (which like the rest of the HEROES Act was crafted by House Democrats) is unlikely to make it into the final text of any future relief bill that gets passed by Congress, however.

Nevertheless, Senate Democrats are also pushing some kind of loan forgiveness in the next bill — their proposal is similar to that of the HEROES Act: The federal government would pay at least $10,000 toward every borrower’s federal student loan balance. Other lawmakers have advocated for loan relief for essential workers, while some progressive advocacy groups, like Young Invincibles, have called for more sweeping relief akin to some of the debt cancellation proposals put forward during the Democratic primary.

Some former Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed using the pandemic to enact sweeping changes to student debt policy.

Shortly after the passage of the CARES Act, former candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren — who proposed forgiving up to $50,000 of debt for federal student loan borrowers during the primary — tweeted, “Student loan debt cancellation MUST be a part of the next emergency coronavirus package.” Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has released a modified version of the progressive plans championed by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders; his plan would cancel the tuition-related undergraduate debt of borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year.

But Republican lawmakers have been resistant to such calls; one GOP aide told Inside Higher Ed members of their caucus have no “appetite for debt forgiveness or cancellation because it has nothing to do with Covid.”

And a Democratic staffer told Higher Ed that Democrats were pessimistic about the chances of any loan forgiveness being included in future bills.

“Republicans balked at the large-scale cancellation of student loans,” the Democratic staffer said of discussions conducted around the CARES Act. “We pushed until the end, but it’s not happening.”

While complete loan forgiveness seems unlikely, lawmakers may be able to find common ground on some forgiveness, either for certain types of workers or a smaller forgiveness amount for all loan holders. And though there’s little sign of the pandemic abating in the US, the country could be in the same dire economic straits it is in at the moment — if things aren’t even worse — come October, when the freeze on loan payments is set to expire. Such a scenario could lead to increased pressure on lawmakers to include provisions assisting borrowers in future aid packages, even if those measures don’t go quite so far as to forgive all outstanding debt.

How the CARES Act affects student loan payments

Starting March 13, with the signing of the CARES Act, student loan interest was temporarily set to zero — for now, this will last until September 30, 2020.

For about 92 percent of borrowers, this freezes however much they owe until then — and ensures there will be no penalty or late fees for not making normal monthly loan payments. For now, all federal student loans have been placed in “administrative forbearance,” a flexible method of suspending payments the Department of Education can use during natural disasters and other emergencies.

There’s no opt-in; even if you have automatic debits set up, there’s nothing you need to do to take advantage of the program. And for those that still have concerns, here is a brief guide with answers to some common questions.

Are any loans being canceled?

The CARES Act does have a provision canceling loans in a very specific case: if you were enrolled and were forced to withdraw from school due to concerns about the coronavirus. The provision does not apply to private or Perkins loans.

Many schools have extended withdrawal deadlines, Dora Gicheva, an economics professor at the University of North Carolina told Vox — with some institutions, like the University of North Carolina, allowing students to withdraw after completing the semester. If you’re unclear about your school’s withdrawal rules, you should contact it directly; it should also have information on what portion of the loan might be eligible for cancellation.

It isn’t clear how many people will be able to benefit from this — but for most people, no, there’s no student loan cancelation. And even for beneficiaries of this rule, loans taken for completed semesters must still be repaid, once the temporary repayment and interest freeze period is over.

What if I have a privately held loan?

None of this applies to federal loans owned by private lenders, private student loans, or federal Perkins loans owned by colleges and universities. A group of Democratic and independent senators has urged private loan holders to provide relief for borrowers — and some, like Navient and Sallie Mae, have agreed to allow borrowers to place private loans in forbearance (generally without the interest freeze borrowers with federally held loans enjoy).

The easiest way to find out who holds your loan is through the Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid website. You’ll need an FSA ID to log in — more recent graduates should already have one, but those who applied for loans using paper applications may need to create one (there’s an option to do so on the homepage of the Federal Student Aid website). After you log in, information about your loans — and who services them — will be available on your dashboard.

If it turns out you have a Perkins loan or another federal loan owned by a private institution, the Department of Education notes you can benefit from the freeze created by the CARES Act by consolidating those other loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan.

Doing so comes with some potential dangers, however. The good news is that if you’re paying multiple loans right now, you’ll have one payment after you consolidate — and that consolidated loans are part of the temporary zero percent interest program. The potential trouble is you could end up with a higher interest rate, forcing you to pay more than you would have otherwise. And, as soon as you consolidate, capitalized interest is added to your balance — so the size of your loan will increase right away.

Whether this is worth the risk will depend on the individual and their future financial outlook, and the details and size of their outstanding interest.

Can I still make payments on my loan?

Yes, you can, and you’ll be doing so at a time when interest isn’t building up. Any payments you make will first be applied to your interest, and once that’s paid off — or if it’s been paid already — your payment will go toward decreasing your loan balance, or principal.

I’m on a special payment plan — will that be affected by this?

The provisions laid out in the CARES Act cover everyone with a federal student loan besides those exceptions mentioned above.

This means if you’re on a repayment plan that’s based on your income, you won’t face any penalties for not sending in your agreed payments for the next few months.

The same is true if you’re on a payment plan arranged with a private collection company — as long as they are one that’s under contract with the Department of Education rather than with a private loan holder. Collectors have been directed by the department not to attempt collections, and not to take out automatic debits from your account.

If you have seen a debit on your account (after this policy went into effect on March 25) the Department of Education asks that you call it at 800.621.3115 (or 877.825.9923 if you are deaf or hearing impaired). Like other federally managed loans, loans in collection are exempt from interest until September 30.

In general, if you’re losing wages because of reduced hours, or from being laid off, you can enroll in (or alter the terms of) an income-driven repayment plan. Basically, you’ll tell the department how much you’re making now, and you’ll be offered a new minimum monthly payment. You can apply for that here on the Federal Student Aid website.

Things are a bit more complicated if you’re on a public service loan forgiveness plan. As long as you’re still working full time (more than 30 hours a week) in a role the Department of Education classifies as public service, you can skip payments until September without penalty. If you are no longer working full time, or have been laid off, you cannot get the benefit unless you obtain a new job that the department classifies as public service — and that meets the weekly hour requirement.

A Department of Education spokesperson told Vox that those who’ve lost public service loan forgiveness eligibility due to Covid-19 should remember that the program only requires a public service worker make 120 monthly payments on a loan, not that they be consecutive. This means if you were in the program, got laid off, and get another qualifying job two years from now, you just need to submit a new certification form with the Department of Education, and after being reapproved, you can pick up where you left off.

What if things are still bad in October?

Lawmakers are approaching most economic issues incrementally at the moment, and no one knows what will happen during the summer. States are reopening nonessential businesses, meaning more people may have paychecks come October. However, reopening could also mean that fewer people are employed in October, should relaxations of stay-at-home orders lead to a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases and deaths — and more stringent lockdowns in response.

Should economic conditions continue to be grim — and economists who spoke with Vox’s Emily Stewart and Dylan Scott believe they could — lawmakers will likely face pressure to extend the temporary loan payment and interest freezes.

In the short term, student loan issues don’t appear to be a candidate for inclusion in the fourth congressional stimulus package, despite House Democrats’ efforts to have it include some measure of loan forgiveness.

The student loan provisions in the HEROES Act do signal Democrats will continue to press the issue, but Republicans have signaled they are concerned about including measures to future stimulus bills that will add to the national debt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said, “We can’t keep throwing endless amounts of borrowed money at the problem in hope to fix it.”

Any compromise legislation between House Democrats and Senate Republicans then, seems more likely to look like what has already been passed — a temporary hold on payments.","How the CARES Act affects student loan paymentsStarting March 13, with the signing of the CARES Act, student loan interest was temporarily set to zero — for now, this will last until September 30, 2020.

The editors of MASSAGE Magazine have curated the following resources to help connect you to the most up-to-date information about paying your student loans during this time.

The CARES Act

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, signed into law in March and then extended in August, has placed most federal student loans into “administrative forbearance”; monthly payments are not required from March 13 to Dec. 31, 2020. (If you already made a payment between March 13 and April 10, you can contact your lender about having it refunded.) This forbearance will not count against your credit record.

If you can afford it, you can also opt out of the administrative forbearance and keep making payments during this time. This option can help pay down the balance of your loan faster, as interest will not accrue during the forbearance period.

Important note: Eligible federal student loans are automatically put into forbearance at no additional charge to you; so if you receive a call or email offering forbearance if you pay a processing fee, it’s a scam. (Use the FTC’s complaint assistant to report it.)

Visit Coronavirus and Forbearance Info for Students, Borrowers, and Parents for answers to many other frequently asked questions about student loan processing during COVID-19.

Forbearance for Privately Serviced Loans

If your student loan is not federally owned, you will need to contact your loan provider to find out if it is offering any assistance during this time and what the terms are; for example, Navient currently offers up to three months with no payment required (but interest still accrues during that time).

If you’re not sure whether your loan is federally owned, check out this list — it contains phone numbers and websites of loan servicers for Department of Education-owned loans.

More Federal Help on the Way?

As of May 16, according to Forbes, a new bill, the HEROES Act — Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act — has passed in the House of Representatives.

The HEROES Act is a $3 trillion stimulus plan intended to provide relief to the U.S. economy, but it also contains help for people with student loans. If passed — which requires passing in the Senate, then signing into law by President Trump — the HEROES Act would, among many other things:

provide $10,000 in loan forgiveness for federal student loan borrowers;

provide $10,000 in loan forgiveness for private student loans;

extend the student loan forbearance specified in the CARES Act through Sept. 2021; and

extend CARES Act coverage to certain loans that had been excluded.

114,"May 18, 2020",NerdWallet,How to Pay Off Dental School Loans: 5 Strategies for Dentists,"The best way to pay off dental school loans will depend on your career path. A dentist starting a general practice has different financial challenges and priorities than an orthodontics resident, for instance.

Based on your post-graduation plans, use these guidelines as a starting point for mapping out your approach.

Private practice: Standard repayment or refinancing.

Residency program: Income-driven repayment, deferment or refinancing.

Public sector: Dental school debt forgiveness and income-driven repayment.

There are five main options to pay off dental school loans. Here's how to figure out which strategy is right for you.

1. Pursue dental school debt forgiveness

Best for: Dentists working in the public or nonprofit sector, or in an underserved area.

Forgiveness will likely be the least expensive way to pay off dental school loans. But it's also one that few dentists pursue.

According to a survey by the American Dental Education Association, 5.6% of dental school graduates in the class of 2019 planned to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness. An additional 3.1% were going to use a service commitment program that forgives debt, such as National Health Service Corps.

Several dental school debt forgiveness programs will pay off debt for dentists who work in the public sector or in an underserved area for a certain period of time. This route is a good option if your career aligns with one of these programs — like you plan to pursue academic dentistry at a nonprofit university, for example.

2. Refinance to pay off dental school loans fast

Best for: Private practice dentists who want to save on interest.

More than half of dental school graduates in the class of 2019 planned to aggressively pay off dental school loans. Dental school loan refinancing is likely the best option if you want to do this.

Refinancing can lower your interest rate, which may save you money and help you pay off dental school loans fast.

For instance, refinancing $292,169 — the average dental school debt among the class of 2019 — from 7% interest to 5% would save you roughly $290 per month and more than $35,200 over a decade, assuming you had 10 years of payments remaining before refinancing and kept the same repayment schedule.

Refinancing can make sense if you plan to work in private practice and are confident you won’t need an income-driven repayment plan or pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness. You lose access to those benefits when you refinance federal student loans.

Want to open your own dental practice? If you want to start a dental practice, you'll likely need a loan to do so. Lenders understand dentists have a lot of student debt. But you'll still want to choose a loan repayment strategy that helps your cash flow. That may mean getting a lower monthly payment by refinancing or enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan. Consider how much you make, how much you owe and your other financial obligations — like a mortgage or car payment — to find the right option.

3. Stick with the standard repayment plan

Best for: Dentists whose payments are manageable.

On the federal standard repayment plan, you’ll make equal monthly payments for 10 years. If those payments are affordable, sticking with the standard plan can make sense.

You’ll save the most in interest on the standard repayment plan among all federal options, and you'll keep federal student loan benefits by not refinancing. You can even make extra payments if you want to pay off dental school loans faster.

4. Enroll in income-driven repayment

Best for: Dental residents; dentists with excessive debt; dentists working in the public sector.

There are four income-driven repayment plans. These plans cap monthly payments at 10% to 20% of your income, making them affordable even during residency. For example, if you earned a $56,000 annual income as a dental resident, your monthly payments could be as low as $315.

Income-driven payments are subject to increase annually as your income increases. And your balance will probably increase because your payments likely won’t cover the interest as it accrues. You may want to revisit other strategies after your residency.

But if your debt vastly outpaces your income, income-driven repayment may be a viable long-term strategy. These plans forgive your remaining debt after 20 or 25 years. Those amounts are taxed, but you may pay less overall than under the standard plan or by refinancing.

Using an income-driven repayment is also a necessity to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

Can you refinance during a dental residency program? Two lenders — SoFi and Laurel Road — offer student loan refinancing for dental residents. However, SoFi will not refinance your dental school loans if you’re taking out additional student loans for residency. Consider refinancing during residency if you’re certain you won’t use income-driven repayment or Public Service Loan Forgiveness. If you refinance during residency, consider refinancing again when your training is complete. You’ll likely qualify for a lower interest rate post-residency.

5. Defer loan payments during residency

Best for: Dental residents in programs that charge tuition.

Whether you’re pursuing a dental specialty or doing a general practice residency, it’s possible to postpone federal loan payments during your training through in-school deferment or mandatory forbearance.

If you’re in a residency program that charges tuition, deferment will likely be necessary. But if you’re in a paid residency program, avoid deferment if possible, because it increases your loan balance. Most dental school loans — except any subsidized loans from your undergraduate studies — continue accruing interest during deferment.

For example, postponing payments for one year on $292,169 — the average dental school debt among the class of 2019 — would add more than $52 in interest per day for a total of almost $19,000, assuming you had a 6.5% average interest rate, didn’t make any interest payments during that time and had no subsidized loans.","Pursue dental school debt forgivenessBest for: Dentists working in the public or nonprofit sector, or in an underserved area.

116,"May 16, 2020",Yahoo Finance,"HEROES Act would cancel $10,000 in student debt for ‘economically distressed’ borrowers","The House has passed the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act HEROES (Act) on Friday night.

The $3 trillion stimulus package, which is expected to be ignored by the Republican-controlled Senate (at least in its current form), would have considerable implications for student loan borrowers.

The legislation would extend the CARES Act provision that automatically suspended interest on federal student loans (as well as payment and involuntary collections) for another year, meaning that federal student loan borrowers would not have to pay back their student loans until September 30, 2021.

And while other protections would extend to borrowers holding commercially-held FFEL-program student loans (as well as Perkins loans), a key provision would forgive up to $10,000 in debt for “economically distressed borrowers” who hold private or federal student loans.

To be considered an economically distressed borrower, a borrower with student loans as of March 12, 2020, should meet the following criteria:

Paying $0 a month on their federal student loans through an income-contingent repayment plan or an income-based repayment plan

Or be in default on their private and/or federal student loans (270 days past due)

Or if the private and/or federal student loan was in serious delinquency, or 90 days past due

Or the student loans were in forbearance or deferment

The bill also expands eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and also forgives loans held by thousands of borrowers who attended the now-defunct, for-profit colleges Corinthian Colleges and ITT.

‘A potentially devastated economy when they start making payments again’

Consumer advocates were frustrated that the cancellation didn’t extend to all borrowers.

The lack of widespread forgiveness “will leave many borrowers without long-term relief... especially low-income borrowers, borrowers of color, and those who lost their jobs due to the pandemic,” Persis Yu, staff attorney and director of NCLC’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project, said in a statement.

Another expert stressed that the extra relief proposed in the bill should not be discounted.

""The Senate should consider and pass the HEROES Act as quickly as possible,” Jessica Thompson, associate vice president at the Institute for College Access & Success, said in a statement. “The bill provides critical support at a scale to match the vastness of the crisis and will help students, colleges, and those with student debt survive the crisis, as well as help facilitate economic recovery.""

117,"May 16, 2020",CNBC,"HEROES Act would provide another stimulus check, broader student loan relief","The House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package Friday, which would provide another round of stimulus checks to millions of eligible Americans and extend expanded unemployment benefits, among other provisions. The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions, or HEROES, Act, clocks in at over 1,800 pages and could provide some additional economic relief at a time when almost 37 million Americans have lost their jobs and many others are facing reduced hours and the loss of health insurance. Here's what you need to know about a few key financial provisions:

Economic impact payments

The bill includes a provision for another round of stimulus checks, or economic impact payments, of up to $6,000 per household. They would be structured similarly to the first round: Individuals earning up to $75,000 would get a one-time $1,200 check, and couples earning up to $150,000 would be eligible for $2,400. There are a few key differences from the first round, though. For one, a maximum of three dependents, regardless of age, would also get $1,200. The first round of stimulus checks excluded adult dependents, including many college students. Additionally, immigrants with taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) would also be eligible for a payment this time around.

Unemployment benefits

For the 30-million-plus Americans who've filed unemployment claims over the past two months, the HEROES Act would extend the measures from the first stimulus package, including extending the extra $600 weekly federal unemployment benefit through January 2021. Gig workers, independent contractors, part-time workers and the self-employed will also be able to take advantage of unemployment benefits through March 2021.

Student loan forgiveness

The CARES Act suspended interest and payments for most people with federal student loans through September 30, 2020. The HEROES Act extends that pause through September 2021, and expands it to all federal student loans, including Federal Perkins Loans and some FFEL Program and HEAL loans not owned by the Department of Education. But it goes much further than that. It cancels up to $10,000 for some federal and private loan holders.

Rental and mortgage assistance

The country's 40-million-plus renters have received little additional federal support since the coronavirus shutdowns began. The HEROES Act changes that, providing around $100 billion for rental assistance. It would be distributed through an existing nationwide grant rental assistance program that would verify a tenant's inability to pay rent and give vouchers to cover the cost of rent and utilities. It would also extend the ban on evictions for nonpayment for a year following its enactment date. The bill also provides $75 billion for a homeowner assistance fund meant to prevent mortgage defaults and property foreclosures.

Hazard pay

The bill would establish a $200 billion ""Heroes' Fund"" to provide hazard pay to some essential workers. This would come in the form of a $13 per hour pay premium on top of their regular pay for ""all hours worked in essential industries through the end of 2020,"" up to $25,000 for essential workers earning less than $200,000 per year and up to $5,000 for workers earning more than $200,000 per year.

House Democrats on Thursday introduced an amendment to their $3 trillion coronavirus relief spending package that significantly scaled back a student-debt provision because of its higher-than-expected cost.

Politico first reported on the amendment, which would limit the number of people who qualify for student-debt relief.

The latest spending-package proposal, called the Heroes Act, initially would have forgiven up to $10,000 for all borrowers of federal and private student loans. But with the revision, debt forgiveness would be restricted only to people who were ""economically distressed"" on March 12, the day before President Donald Trump declared a national emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Borrowers would be categorized as in dire financial straits if their monthly payment would amount to zero on an income-based repayment plan, or if they were in default or delinquent on their payments.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated the initial provision would have cost $250 billion to $300 billion, a much heftier price tag than Democratic lawmakers had expected, Politico reported.

Progressives are likely to be critical of the new amendment.

Other elements of the spending package have elicited some backlash. Democrats are trying to temporarily suspend a cap on the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted from federal income taxes — that would benefit mostly high-income taxpayers in highly taxed states and cost about $137 billion to implement, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan arm of Congress.

The Cares Act, enacted in March, suspended interest, payments, and collection on student loans through September 30, according to The Washington Post. The Democratic bill would extend those breaks until September 2021.

Republicans have staunchly opposed the House legislation and described it as an unrealistic liberal wish list that would pile more money on the federal debt. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday also lambasted another provision that would send $1,200 stimulus checks to immigrants shut out of the initial wave of direct payments.

119,"May 13, 2020",The Denver Channel,Lawmakers consider student loan forgiveness for front-line workers,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – On the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are saving lives. Communities around the country have shown their gratitude with street shows of lights and sirens, while legislators in the nation’s capital have started to consider more tangible gratitude, like possible student loan forgiveness.

“That loan forgiveness in Congress is absolutely warranted and does have a place in the fourth supplemental,” said Matthew Shick with the Association of American Medical Colleges.

AAMC is advocating for a student loan forgiveness bill that would help health care workers specifically.

“It could ease the financial burden and focus on what is in front of them,” Shick added.

However, Congress has some tough decisions ahead.

There are several different student loan forgiveness bills and proposals on the hill. S.2235 and H.R.6363 are two bills that tackle student loan forgiveness for almost everyone with student loan debt. They each cap the amount to be forgiven, while other broad student loan forgiveness proposals effort a forgiveness of all federal student loan debt.

In contrast to the broad student loan forgiveness proposals, in recent weeks, two narrow student loans forgiveness bills have been introduced. The HEROES Act (H.R.6800) and the Student Loan Forgiveness for Frontline Healthcare Workers Act (H.R.6720) focus on workers on the frontlines.

The HEROES Act proposes student loan forgiveness for healthcare workers and other essential workers, capping it though at $25,000 per person. The Student Loan Forgiveness for Frontline Healthcare Workers Act proposes eliminating all graduate school debt for healthcare workers, specifically.

“This might be the turning point to really invest in our physician workforce, to not only address COVID-19, but future public health crises,” Shick added.

Before this pandemic, the U.S. was already dealing with a growing doctor shortage, especially in lower-paying specialties and in rural communities.

The AAMC predicts the U.S. could see of shortage of 122,000 physicians by 2032. However, AAMC also believes, by eliminating some or all of their debt, more physicians could afford to serve in lower-paying but much needed specialties. Thus, after the pandemic is over, the country could be in a better position to address the doctor shortage and distribution issues in specialties and in underserved communities.

“I think the biggest lesson we can earn from the pandemic is that you can’t wait until the last minute to act and you need to be thinking about the future, because this isn’t the last pandemic. It is not the last health crisis,” said Shick.

Executive Summary

The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act, the proposed fourth coronavirus aid package, contains several education provisions that expand upon those that were in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Under HEROES, “economically distressed” student loan holders would see up to $10,000 in outstanding balances forgiven, which could cost up to $31 billion in lost revenue for the Department of Education.

HEROES initially provided $10,000 in forgiveness for all holders of student loans, which would have cost the Department of Education up to $440 billion, but that provision was ultimately dropped due to cost concerns.

HEROES would provide an additional $90 billion in state grants to be used for early childhood, elementary, secondary, and post-secondary education systems; a third of funds must go to higher education institutions.

Introduction

Democrats in the House of Representatives recently released the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act, a fourth-phase federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The HEROES Act contains multiple provisions for the federal government to cancel student debt and provide additional funding for education systems.

Student Loan Forbearance and Forgiveness

Under the HEROES Act, students, including those with private loans, would see their loan repayments suspended, interest free, until September 30th, 2021. Economically distressed student borrowers would also be eligible for up to $10,000 in loan forgiveness. HEROES defines economically distressed students as those who are 30 or more days delinquent on their student loans, or in deferment/forbearance prior to March 12, 2020. The bill originally extended forgiveness to all holders of federal and private loans, which could have cost up to $440 billion, but this provision was scaled back due to cost concerns. As of Q1 2020, about 3.1 million federal student loan holders were delinquent or in default out of a total of 45.2 million. In total, the current forgiveness provision would cost the Department of Education about $31.4 billion compared to the prior $440 billion.

These provisions contrast with those in the Coronavirus Assistance, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which provided loan forgiveness for students that dropped out for the semester and suspended loan repayments, interest free, until September 2020 for only federal student-loan borrowers.

Additional Funding for States and Higher Education Institutions

Under HEROES, the Department of Education would provide up to $90 billion through September 2022 for states to use on their early childhood, elementary, secondary, and post-secondary education systems. A third of this total must go toward higher education institutions. In contrast, the CARES Act provided about $14 billion, which the Department of Education distributed directly to colleges.

The allocation formula under HEROES is very similar to that of CARES, however. Under CARES, the federal government allocated funds to colleges based upon the number of full-time Pell Grant recipients at a specific college. Pell Grants are rewarded to students that demonstrate financial need. Unlike loans, the grants do not need to be paid back. The CARES allocation formula used Pell Grants as a proxy for the number of low-income students at a specific institution, thereby weighting the distributed funds more heavily toward schools with higher numbers of low-income students.

The challenge with allocating funds by the number of full-time Pell Grant recipients is that community colleges lose out on funding because about 65 percent of students at community colleges are enrolled part-time. The Pell Grant program also tends to underserve many eligible students. In California, for example, about 20 percent of community college students qualified for Pell Grants but did not receive them. These factors have reduced the amount that community colleges have received in CARES and therefore would receive under HEROES.

Conclusion

The HEROES Act has two key implications for education. It provides relief for economically distressed student debt holders by cancelling their balances by up to $10,000; this provision would ultimately cost the federal government up to $31.4 billion. Second, HEROES, much like CARES, prioritizes relief funding for four-year universities over two-year community colleges.","InsightTom LeeExecutive SummaryThe Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act, the proposed fourth coronavirus aid package, contains several education provisions that expand upon those that were in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

While you have several ways to lower payments on your federal student loans, you don’t have as many options for private student loan repayment. Each private lender decides if it will offer student loan forbearance or other assistance, and unfortunately, most have limited flexibility.

Whether you already have a private student loan or are considering borrowing one, it’s important to know about these limitations and how they affect repayment. Here are some of the challenges (and potential solutions) for private student loan repayment:

Private student loan forbearance

If you’re having trouble repaying your student loans, your lender might offer you a few forms of limited relief. Some of the best lenders provide the option for deferment or forbearance of private student loan payments.

However, this forbearance is usually only offered in specific circumstances and is subject to the lender’s approval. Plus, private student loan deferments and forbearances are designed to give you a temporary break from payments, not long-term relief. After your forbearance is up, a private lender will expect you to resume paying this debt.

Refinancing private student loans

Your best option for relief from private student loan repayment might be to refinance your private loans. You can refinance private student loans with a variety of banks.

In this case, the goal is simple: refinance student loans to interest rates that are lower than what you currently pay, which might also reduce your private student loan payment amounts.

First, however, there’s one important caveat. You’ll need to qualify for student loan refinancing. Most refinancing providers look for a strong credit score and income (or a creditworthy cosigner). This is one reason why it’s important to improve your credit score, which will influence whether you’re approved.

Private student loan forgiveness

If you’re hoping to get rid of private student loans through forgiveness or bankruptcy, note that both outcomes are rare.

That said, there are some programs that provide private student loan forgiveness or repayment assistance, often dependent on your occupation or employment.

Bankruptcy discharge for private student debt

Discharging private student loans through bankruptcy is difficult, and in most cases won’t be possible. Still, private student loan discharges are sometimes granted in cases of extreme hardship, or if the borrower used the loans to attend a for-profit school they claim defrauded them.

While this might be good news for some people, the criteria (at least in this example) are fairly complicated and likely require a lawyer’s assistance.

Private student loans with variable rates

Unlike federal student loans, which all have fixed rates that don’t change, private student loans can have variable interest rates that increase (or decrease) over time, based on overall market rates.

When your interest rates go up, you have little recourse with private loans other than to apply to refinance. Keep in mind that you’ll need good credit to get student loan refinancing rates that beat what you’re currently paying.

Target private loan repayment first

If you can’t get relief on private student loan repayment through refinancing, forbearance or another strategy, your best remaining option is probably to just pay off your private student loans. You’ll need to list your debt and decide which student loans to repay first. Since private student loans have fewer benefits and protections, it can make sense to target those first.

If you decide to do so, simply modify the debt snowball method to prioritize payment of private student loans:

Pay at least the minimum amount on all student loans, both private and federal.

Find extra funds in your budget and make a monthly extra payment toward the private student loan that you want to pay off first. This could be the loan with the highest interest rate, lowest balance or worst forbearance options.

Continue to do this each month until the private student loan is paid off.

Once this top-priority private student loan is paid off, continue with the next private loan until it’s paid off as well.

If your private loans are small in value or have lower interest rates, then this strategy might not make clear financial sense right now.

Just keep in mind that you always have more flexibility with federal student loans, should you have to adjust your repayment strategy down the road. So, you might want to take every chance you have to pay off the private loans first.

Despite these potential issues with repayment, a private student loan can still make sense for some students and borrowers. If you’re aware of these drawbacks, you can shop for private student loans that provide these protections. Once in repayment, you can proactively manage private student loans to avoid these problems.

For parents, the payments are even higher, tacking on an extra $500 per child.

Though the stimulus checks are designed to help soften the blow for those who have been laid off or seen their wages cut due to COVID-19, the payments also have the power to help Americans still actively in the workforce, too — specifically, those seeking student loan repayment benefits.

In fact, the coronavirus crisis has set student loan interest rates to historic lows, encouraging many with student loan debt to consider refinancing.

First, there’s the option to use your stimulus check to increase monthly payments toward your student loan balance. Doing so would lower interest rate costs in the long-term and help you pay off your federal student loans sooner.

If you have federal student loans, you’ll need to contact your student aid servicer to go this route. Under the CARES Act, all federal loans have automatically gone into forbearance, and no autopayments are being processed until October. No interest is being charged during this time period either. In addition to making extra payments, you can also use this time to:

“Since interest rates are at one of the lowest points we may see in our lifetime, borrowers that do not qualify for the PSLF (Public Service Loan Forgiveness) program or other forgiveness programs should seriously consider refinancing their loans to a lower interest rate,” said Randy Lupi, regional vice president at Equitable Advisors, noting refinancing student loans could be a good move.

If you work in a public service field, you might qualify to have your student loan debts forgiven under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (PSLF). The CARES Act offers an extra benefit to borrowers on these plans (more on that below), so it’s an especially smart time to enroll if you’re eligible.

WHAT QUALIFIES YOU FOR STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS?

Consolidate loans

Consolidating your loans — or rolling them into a single loan, is also an option. You can even roll other debts, like credit cards, personal loans, private student loan debt and other loan amounts into the mix as well. This streamlines your student loan repayment process (there’s just one payment a month) and depending on your interest rates, it could lower your costs as well.

Before you commit to consolidation, make sure you understand the pros and cons — particularly, compared to student loan refinancing — to determine if it meets your goals. Refinancing may make more sense if you're looking to combine loans, change repayment terms, lower monthly costs or more.

What student loan benefits does the CARES Act include?

Stimulus checks aside, the CARES Act also includes a few key perks for student loan borrowers. As previously mentioned, all borrowers with federal loans will see their payments paused through the end of September. This is called “forbearance.”

No interest will accrue on federal loan balances during this time, and no payments will be reported late to any credit bureau. There’s also no action required to reap these benefits.

5 WAYS TO PAY OFF PARENT PLUS LOANS FAST

On the downside, though, these benefits are only available if your loan is owned by the federal government. And according to Travis Hornsby, found and CEO at Student Loan Planner, many Americans won’t qualify for them.

“Unfortunately, this bill does absolutely nothing for borrowers with private student loans, FFEL loans held by a commercial lender, or the Department of Health student loans,” Hornsby said. “The government stopped issuing FFELP loans in 2010, so anyone who graduated or went to school before that time likely has this kind of student loan and does not qualify.”

Does the CARES Act include federal direct student loan forgiveness?

Though borrowers were no doubt hoping the CARES Act would offer some sort of loan forgiveness benefit, it, unfortunately, does not. For those that qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, there is a nice perk, though.

The PSLF program requires borrowers to make at least 120 on-time payments toward their loan before the balance can be wiped clean. Under the CARES Act, all skipped payments during the forbearance period (through September 30) will count toward that qualifying number.

“The good news for borrowers enrolled in Public Service Loan Forgiveness is that they will receive credit toward their qualifying payments during this administrative forbearance, as long as they were already in the program and continue to meet other eligibility requirements related to their employer and full-time status,” explained Amy Lins, senior director of learning and development at Money Management International. “These payments will also count toward income-driven repayment plan payments and forgiveness.”

Don’t forget to pad that savings account

At the end of the day, it’s important to think long-term during the current health crisis — especially as checks from the federal government's coronavirus stimulus package start rolling in. Though paying down your student loans can be smart, you also want to stow away some emergency funds if you’re able to, too.

124,"May 8, 2020",Bloomberg Law,,"In Part 1 we discussed how to make wise decisions before taking on law school debt. Now we will discuss two of the most significant decisions for graduates: Should you consider income-based repayment or refinance your loans?



Income-Based Repayment

Some applicants, students, and recent graduates have heard about income-driven repayment plans and consider that a cure-all for any concerns about debt. Income-driven repayment can be a good option for some graduates, but law school debtors need to know the risks involved.

For federal loans (as opposed to loans from private lenders) graduates usually have the option to use an income-driven repayment plan. There are a variety of income-based repayment plans. The details are different, but the gist is the same. Instead of paying a set amount monthly, you pay a percentage of your income. The percentage is calculated based on differing formulas for each type of plan and can vary based on other socio-economic circumstances, like family size. This can reduce your monthly payment below what you would pay under a standard repayment plan.

The immediate financial flexibility of income-driven repayment plans is appealing. But it comes with drawbacks. Because you are paying below what a standard repayment plan requires, you are likely accruing additional interest and increasing the total amount owed.

Take for example, this story shared on Twitter by a former student who has paid on time every month and now owes nearly $70,000 more in student loans due to unpaid interest.



My fed student loan debt was $208,340.15 when I graduated in 2014. Now, 5.5 years later, after making my IBR payment every month, I owe $275,004.15. https://t.co/IHf1wlFQS4 — Legally W(h)ining (@WineAboutLaw) February 12, 2020

That increased amount is particularly scary because, in certain situations, that additional unpaid interest could become part of the principal owed on the loan, an event called capitalization. After capitalization, interest is calculated off the combined amount of the original principal and plus the unpaid interest. (Before, the unpaid interest was kept separate, and no interest was charged on it.)



Loan Forgiveness

So why does anyone do an income-driven repayment plan if you are unlikely to ever pay off loans under them? Because income-driven repayment plans may come with potential loan forgiveness too. Again, the details vary by plan, but an individual can receive loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years. Or, for those who are in certain qualifying public interest jobs, an individual can participate in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives loans after 10 years. Those who qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program can save thousands of dollars (potentially six figures’ worth) in overall loan payments.

So, if there’s loan forgiveness, why would anyone not do an income-driven repayment plan? A few reasons. First, some may face a “tax bomb.” A tax bomb refers to the fact that when loans are forgiven, the forgiven amount is treated as income, which has to be taxed. (This is not a problem, however, for those participating in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which has specifically made the loan forgiveness non-taxable.)

Unlike income from an employer, no one withholds taxes for loan forgiveness. So debtors will owe significant amount of taxes for the forgiveness. In fact, the amount owed will usually be worse the lower someone’s income is, because that means less interest has been paid and more has to be forgiven in the end.

Second, in some circumstances, you may pay more in the long run. For those going to non-BigLaw jobs, income is likely to risk steadily over time. So the amount paid under an income-driven repayment plan will also grow. Worse, capitalization can inflict additional interest and raise the maximum amount you are required to pay under the income-driven repayment plan. And if you ever move to a significantly higher paying job, you may have to pay the standard repayment rate—without any of the benefits of paying it off sooner.

Third, loan forgiveness is subject to political whims. As recently reported, the current administration is considering cuts to the loan forgiveness programs. There is always a chance that what may be available today will be taken away tomorrow without any promise that borrowers won’t be left holding the bag.

Similarly, the process for receiving forgiveness is notoriously opaque, posing a risk someone believes they’ll receive forgiveness, only to find out a bureaucratic misstep has cost them thousands of dollars.

Now these risks are just that: risks. Income-drive repayment plans still make sense for many borrowers. But they are not a guarantee, as some treat them.



Refinancing Loans

Another option graduates should consider is privately refinancing their loans. Refinancing means a private lender pays off your loans on your behalf and you now pay the private lender. Private lenders will generally give a lower interest rate than the federal rate. How much better the rate is depends on a lot of variables: your credit history, the term (length) of the loan, whether you want a fixed (set for the life of the loan) or variable (subject to change based on market rates) interest rates.

Generally, the biggest drop in interest rate will come if you reduce the term of the loan. You can reduce your interest rate by as much as five percentage points. That may not sound like a big deal. But if you switch from a 25-year loan at 6.58% (the average federal rate) to a 5-year loan at 3%, you will save over $140,000 in interest over the life of the loan.

Of course, you will have to pay much more per month (about $1,700 more). While the increased monthly payments are difficult, those savings are huge. Even if you keep a 25-year term, if you can save one percentage point, you will save about $30,000 over the life of the loan. Refinancing for a lower interest rate can have huge savings.

Refinancing has its tradeoffs. The biggest loss is that you lose out on the opportunity to participate in the loan forgiveness programs. Similarly, federal loans offer significant protections for financial hardships. While private lenders offer some protections, they are not as expansive.

Finally, graduates who have spouses or children should check what kind of protections lenders give upon the death of the borrower. The federal government generally forgives loans upon death, while private lenders’ rules vary significantly.

Income-driven repayment and privately refinancing benefit different segments of borrowers. Low-income individuals will generally benefit from (and possibly depend on) income-driven repayment to make monthly finances work. Refinancing allows individuals with higher incomes to pay their loans off quicker and save significant money in the long run. Those in between should become familiar with the options they have; the difference can be thousands of dollars.

Is Myfedloan.org Legit?

Yes, Myfedloan.org is a legitimate company. That is just one of the numerous services for student loans that the United States Department of Education has contracted for taking care of student loans.

FedLoan was founded in 2009 by PHEAA to offer assistance to the United States Department of Education by handling federal student loans, specifically Direct Loans, and FFEL or Federal Family Educational Loans. Unfortunately, the company has a reputation for inadequate customer service.

How Do I Get Started with MyFedLoan?

The first thing you need to do when aiming to successfully repay your loans through MyFedLoan is to create an account. This only takes a few minutes and requires you to enter your name, Social Security number, and account number. The company should have sent you an account number, but if you don’t have it handy, you can call the company and answer a series of questions to confirm your identity and receive your account number.

Then, you’ll be asked to set up a password. Your account will host valuable personal information, so you must choose a strong unique password.

Once you’re logged in, you will be able to see all your loans and associated information. This includes the total balance of your loan, minimum monthly payments, and more. From here, you will be able to add a bank account and set up a direct debit to make automatic monthly payments. You may qualify for an interest rate reduction of 0.25% for utilizing the automatic student loan servicing option.

There is also additional information within MyFedLoan portal on how student loans work, FAQs, information about special programs for teacher loan and military loan options as well as a brief overview of your repayment options.

FedLoan Services and Assistance

In addition to the primary loan and repayment options, FedLoan offers several different types of services and assistance to help students with their loans.

Assistance With Appropriate Repayment Plans

If the student is experiencing difficulty making the monthly payments, FedLoan offers options for changing the repayment plan to an income-based repayment plan and/or lower monthly payments.

If the student is experiencing financial hardships, payments they can suspend them through several different options with MyFedLoan.

Students carrying student loan debt and ongoing payments frequently experience issues with paying off their debt and making extra money before they enter their full-time careers. MyFedLoan understands this and helps students navigate these financial uncertainties

Loan Consolidation

If the student has multiple loans, there is often an option for loan consolidation. They can sometimes get an interest rate reduction with a fixed interest rate. The result is decreasing the monthly payment amount. The student can accomplish this by contacting the servicer.

How Do I Make Loan Payments with MyFedLoan?

You can make payments online monthly to MyFedLoan via the website or on the app. Once you create an account and log in, you will see which payment plan you are enrolled in as well as your student loan financial information. Most people will be in a 10-year standard repayment plan, equal to 120 qualifying payments. This means that it will take ten years to pay off your total loan balance.

If you want to set an automatic payment and not have to worry about logging in each month, you can do so on the MyFedLoan website or app. Simply add your bank account and log out. Users must make their payments via a bank account. This means that users will have to provide an account and routing number. If users do not want to make a payment online, they can use the app or pay by phone.

If you’d like to submit a larger monthly contribution, insert the amount that you want to pay each month and set it as a recurring payment. You can also send one-time payments in the app or online, so if you ever have extra cash and the motivation to pay down your loan, you can do so via this platform.

What Are My Repayment Options?

While many borrowers choose to stick with the standard ten-year repayment plan, there are other options available. Some people can’t handle the monthly payment right after graduation, so they choose a longer-term.

Others do not earn enough to make monthly payments, so they choose to enroll in a forgiveness program such as the PSLF program for public servants and teacher loan forgiveness. If you are interested in other options, here are a few of the most popular alternatives that you can explore with MyFedLoan.

Standard Repayment

If you are able to afford a larger monthly payment, a standard repayment is the quickest payment plan offered for repaying your loan. They offer a 10-year term for unconsolidated loans and a 30-year term for consolidated loans.

Graduated Repayment

This option is like the standard repayment, but instead of making the same payment every month for ten years, borrowers start with lower monthly premiums.

Then, the premiums increase every two years. The first two years’ payments typically only cover interest and not the principal of the loan. This is a good option for people who want to contribute to their loans but do not have a high-paying job right after college. As you climb up the career ladder, your student loan payment will increase along with your earnings.

You'll end up paying a lot more in interest, so stay away from this option if at all possible.

Student Loan Repayment Alternatives

Don't worry if you are having trouble coming up with your student loan payment every month. MyFedLoan offers flexible repayment options if you're not able to have a successful repayment of your loan during a stressful time.

Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE)

This plan factors in a borrower’s income and family situation. Borrowers enter information about their income and dependents to determine a monthly payment that is about 10% of their discretionary income. The term on this loan is 20 years. If, after 20 years, you have not repaid the loan, the remainder is forgiven.

Income-Based Repayment

The income-based repayment option is like the PAYE option.

The difference is that borrowers pay 15% of their discretionary income for 25 years, and the loan is then forgiven. This option is common for borrowers under the Parent PLUS loan.

Every year, users must ‘recertify’ their family size and income, and a new payment amount is calculated.

Income-Sensitive Repayment

If you need the flexibility of making smaller monthly payments, this short-term plan allows you to do so for up to five years. They base your new amount due on your income and all accruing interest. However, it has a maximum loan term of 15 years and is only available to those who had their loans distributed through the Federal Family Education Loan program.

Income Contingent Repayment

You will be eligible for student loan forgiveness after 25 years of qualifying payments. During this time, you will make monthly payments of the lowest of 20% of your monthly discretionary income or the amount that is equivalent to a 12-year fixed term.

Extended Fixed Repayment

If you have over $30,000 in outstanding Direct Loans or FFEL Program loans, you'll qualify to extend your loan term from 10 years to 25 years. While this may seem great at first, you'll want to consider the repercussions of more student loan interest over the course of the loan for the sake of lower monthly bills.

Extended Graduated Repayment Plan

Student loan borrowers may opt for this plan which extends the term of their graduated repayment plan for up to 25 years. Again, MyFed Loan requires that the public have either $30,000 in outstanding direct loans or FFEL program loans. The monthly premiums will be lower in the beginning and gradually increase over time.

Revised-Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE)

This payment plan is similar to PAYE, but MyFedLoan takes your spouse's income into consideration if applicable. For traditional undergraduate programs, the term is 20 years, and loan forgiveness is granted afterward. For graduate and professional studies, the term is 25 years, and loan forgiveness is offered afterward.

How Does MyFedLoan Compare to Other Servicers?

Student loan debt is a sensitive topic, and therefore the reviews online are very critical of MyFedLoan. From our research, we’ve found that most federal student loan servicers have similar reviews. Here are a few pros and cons of MyFedLoan:

Pros

As one of the largest student loan servicers, it has a well-built system and official account access

Users have many loan repayment options

The alerts system for payments is easy to use, especially on the app

Cons

The most common complaint is that the website doesn’t process payments correctly, especially additional payments to a specific loan

MyFedLoan has received hundreds of 1-star fedloan servicing reviews

MyFedLoan had an ‘F' rating from the Better Business Bureau in the past

Reports indicate that they don't process payments correctly and that it's difficult to apply payments to a single loan or make extra payments

Errors from the student loan servicing provider resulted in unnecessary loan interest tax charges or a lower credit score

While these pros and cons are valid, the company has made statements that it is consistently backing up programs and improving them. The company is a trusted partner of the U.S. Department of Education and therefore, must adhere to its standards. Remember that all student loans allow for an interest tax deduction on your annual tax return.

Can You Negotiate With FedLoan?

Although it is possible to reach a settlement, when it is a FedLoan serviced nonprofit loan, the borrower must adhere to the judgment of the lender. The only way FedLoan will negotiate is if the loan is close to, or in default.

If this happens, it is dependant on if the borrower already has or can save enough to pay the entire settlement within a few installments or if FedLoan will make a higher profit by settling rather than pursuing payment of the loan.

Trying to force negotiations by missing payments on a student loan is not recommended. Credit can easily be damaged, the loan can significantly increase due to collection costs, and any savings are generally less than expected. There is no guarantee FedLoan will offer negotiations. After nonpayment for 270 days, federal student loans automatically go to default.

Common Complaints Against MyFedLoan

You will find numerous negative MyFedLoan reviews due to customer service issues. The customer service team has been called “inconsistent, incompetent and unhelpful” by students with federal loans.

Poor Customer Service

According to one of the FedLoan servicing reviews, a customer called in several different times and received different answers from members of the FedLoan customer service team representatives. A borrower stated a simple request required months for processing. Another borrower called MyFedLoan between 10 and 15 times during three years to correct mistakes made by the company.

Another complaint is borrowers requiring an account audit. A 30-day audit may take as long as six months.

Student Loan Forgiveness Issues

There have been numerous complaints regarding the way FedLoan Servicing handles requests for loan forgiveness. The most common complaint is that FedLoan makes no calculations regarding how many payments are necessary to count as a qualification for the programs.

To get your federal student loan forgiven, the borrower is required to make 120 qualified payments. Numerous complaints have been filed out of frustration by borrowers discovering they were short because FedLoan did not perform their job properly.

One borrower was forced to refinance due to an inaccurate payment count by FedLoan. In some cases, complaints were filed with the Better Business Bureau. Another common complaint is there is not enough information available about PSLF.

Lawsuits

Numerous borrowers issued complaints because when they spoke to a customer service representative about the program, it was obvious the representatives did not understand the program or how it worked. The FedLoan issues regarding PSLF became so poor, the Attorney General of Massachusetts filed a lawsuit in 2017 against FedLoan.

According to the complaint filed, Maura Healey accused FedLoan of being responsible for public servants being denied assistance and benefits through both the TEACH Grant and PSLF Grant programs. The Attorney General asked for restitution for all of the borrowers impacted in addition to penalties for the FedLoan Servicer. Additional lawsuits against FedLoan have since been filed.

Financial Hardships

Numerous complaints have been received regarding the way requests for income-driven repayment are being handled by FedLoan. Borrowers unable to afford their monthly payments are offered some relief with this type of repayment plan.

In certain instances, lousy information was provided by customer service representatives as to the plans available and how they work. Plan requests have been completely mishandled forcing borrowers to make bigger and unaffordable payments.

Even if students are doing all they can to make extra money, there have been complaints that MyFedLoan is less than helpful in these situations.

Payment Issues

One borrower claimed FedLoan required several months to correct this issue. This resulted in the borrower paying more than $800 per month for the standard repayment plan as opposed to the $105 per month that should have been paid. There have also been many complaints regarding the way payment processing is being handled by FedLoan.

The majority of complaints claimed payments were not applied correctly by MyFedLoan to outstanding loans. One borrower received a letter from FedLoan stating an adjustment was required for the account. The result was an increase of $2,000 for the principal balance. When the borrower contacted FedLoan, no response was received.

Another borrower discovered payments continued to be deducted from the associated checking account despite the loan having been paid in full.

Why FedLoan Payments Increase

One of the main reasons for an increase is a change in the calculations used for the interest rate. The interest paid is compounded daily for student loans. This can result in a larger monthly payment. When a month contains 31 days as opposed to 28, the monthly payment will be higher simply because the month has additional days. More interest is charged due to these extra days.

Any loan using a variable interest rate as opposed to a fixed-rate can change. If the LIBOR or Prime Lending rates increase, the borrower may see a difference in the amount of the monthly payment. Banks offer favored customers a better interest rate referred to as the Prime Lending rate.

Some of the leading banks throughout the world charge a LIBOR rate for short-term loans. The payments may not be going where the borrower believes.

Not Seeing The Principle Change? Here Are A Couple of Reasons

There are two reasons no progress is being made for the total amount of the loan.

The first is the payment distribution if the borrower has more than one loan. The second is how the payments are being applied by the lender. When a monthly payment is made on the loan, the funds are applied in a certain order by the lender. The lender covers any late fees owed first. Funds are then applied to the interest. Funds are applied to the principal balance last.

If the borrower has multiple loans, each loan most likely has a different interest rate. If the payment is evenly distributed by the lender among all of the loans, the chance is good any difference in the balance of loans with a higher interest rate will be minimal.

The best option is to contact the lender to have a larger portion of the payment applied to the loans with a higher interest rate. If the borrower has the cash available, it is a good idea to make an extra payment specifically for the loan with the highest interest rate.

Consequences of Not Paying MyFedLoan

If FedLoan receives no payment on a federal student loan for over 270 days, it automatically goes into default. It is far from uncommon for a student to experience difficulty paying off a student loan. According to the most recent figures, of all borrowers, paying off student loans between 2017 and 2018, 13.5 percent defaulted in three years.

Interest will continue to accrue on ignored loans, and the balance will increase. If the borrower does not accept a repayment option or take advantage of a manage repayment tool, they will send the debt to collections. The result? In addition to the interest, expensive fees are added to the loan.

The borrower's credit score will be negatively affected, making it more difficult to obtain an apartment lease, credit card, auto loan or mortgage. If the student defaults on a federal loan, the government can take 15 percent of the borrower's wages!

They may also sue the borrower, although this is not common. Federal student loans do not have a statute of limitations. As long as the borrower is alive, they can be sued for nonpayment of the loan. In contrast, private loans do have a statute of limitations set by each state.

A federal loan will never go away and should be paid in full.

If your student loan payment isn't due, you can change your loan due date. However, there are a few criteria that you must meet.

You must:

Be in active repayment

Make your first scheduled payment on time

Be current on your monthly payments

Change your date for between the 1st and 28th of each month

Please note that it won't be an immediate change, and may take up to two billing cycles to take effect. This means that you must meet your existing payment dates until it is changed. Your request may cause two payments to be due at once within a 30-day billing cycle depending on when you make the request in comparison to your due date.

What options do I have if I can't afford my loan payment?

If you foresee not being able to afford your loan repayment progress, make sure to contact MyFedLoan to have a conversation about your payment options.

Here are some choices that MyFedLoan may offer you:

Changing your due date

Switching your payment plan

Postpone payments via a deferment or emergency administrative forbearance

If I'm still in school, why I am getting a bill?

If you're still in school or have switched schools, you may receive a bill because MyFedLoan hasn't updated your enrollment status yet. This can take a few weeks. But, if you'd like to get ahead go ahead and make the extra payment or request a general forbearance by logging into your account. Once your status is updated in their system, you'll stop receiving the unnecessary bills.

Are Student Loans Forgiven For Teachers?

There are three programs for student loan forgiveness for teachers – the Public Service Loan Forgiveness, Teacher Loan Forgiveness, and Perkins loans, Teacher Cancellation. These loans can forgive a portion of or the entire federal student loan. However, none of these programs apply to private loans.

Remember, there may be forgiveness options for private loans available directly through the lender. The qualification for federal loans is teaching for five consecutive, full-time years at a qualified low-income secondary or elementary school. Borrowers with Stafford or Federal Direct loans are also qualified.

As previously stated, a maximum of $17,500 can be forgivable in the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program. The program is for qualified teachers without a significant amount of debt. The program is not nearly as generous as forgiveness with a Public Service Loan, but the forgiveness is issued much faster.

The borrower begins by checking school eligibility where they work through the Teacher Cancellation Low Income Directory. The specific amount forgiven is based on the grade levels and subjects taught.

Special education, science, and math teachers can receive forgiveness for as much as $17,500. Secondary and elementary school teachers can receive forgiveness for a maximum of $5,000, depending on the subjects taught.

How Many Times Can You Get Teacher Loan Forgiveness?

The most straightforward answer to the question is one. There is a type of exception due to the numerous programs available for student loan forgiveness, such as Teacher Loan Forgiveness and PSLF. If a teacher is working at an eligible private or public school, they can pursue both Teacher Loan and Public Loan Forgiveness programs. Although borrowers can pursue more than one program, all qualified payments at the time the loans are forgiven will only be applicable for one program.

There are different qualifications, timelines, and requirements for each student loan forgiveness program. That means it is not possible to qualify for two programs at the same time. If the situations are consecutive, there is an exception. If, after five years, the borrower receives approval for Teacher Loan Forgiveness, qualification for PSLF is possible after making an additional 120 payments.

128,"May 6, 2020",Yahoo Finance,"New bill would give essential workers $25K for tuition, student loans","As Congress eyes the next phase of coronavirus relief, some lawmakers want to help pay frontline workers’ student loans or higher education costs.

“Grocery clerks didn't take that job at relatively modest wages thinking they were saving the world,” said Rep. Ann Kuster (D-NH) in an interview with Yahoo Finance.

A new bill introduced this week would give essential workers $25,000 in student debt relief— or for college tuition or costs of a workforce development or continuing education program. Kuster and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) introduced the Opportunities for Heroes Act on Tuesday. The bill has several other Democratic cosponsors, but Fitzpatrick is the only Republican on board so far.

“Our essential workers put their lives at risk every day to make sure the rest of us are safe and healthy,” said Fitzpatrick in a statement. “They deserve all of the help we can provide them. By providing the option to help pay their student loans or continue their education, we can give them one less thing to worry about.”

If the bill were to become law, the Secretary of Labor would establish a new commission to determine which workers are deemed essential and eligible for the $25,000. Some of the positions the bill specifically mentions include healthcare workers, first responders, pharmacy workers, grocery store workers and postal workers.

“It’s hard to envision literally every type of essential worker,” said Kuster. “We want it to be inclusive. We want to make sure that people are recognized even if the role they played is more obscure.”

Essential workers who worked at least 480 hours in a 120-day period during the COVID-19 crisis would be eligible. Workers who couldn’t reach 480 hours due to a case of COVID-19 would still be eligible.

The bill would allow workers to transfer the money to a family member. For example, if an essential worker did not have student loans or a desire to go to college, they could use the money to pay for their child’s education.

Story continues

“It’s not just the workers that are at risk, but these frontline essential workers can bring the virus home—the contagion home — and put their families in jeopardy as well,” said Kuster. “We're recognizing the contribution of the families.”

Kuster said she’s working to include the bill, or at least some form of higher education benefits, in the next stimulus package. The CARES Act granted some student loan relief, including a six-month suspension of some student loan payments — but experts say it’s not nearly enough.

Right now there are a few proposals floating around DC. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced a bill this week to forgive student loan debt for healthcare workers. Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) and Ilhan Omar have a plan to cancel $30,000 in debt per borrower. While moving any debt forgiveness legislation through the Republican-controlled Senate could be an uphill battle, Kuster believes her Republican co-sponsor is a promising sign.

“I think there'll be a debate about the parameters of the program,” said Kuster. “This would be part of the economic stimulus package... to make sure that people are going back to school or getting back to work, that they're stimulating the economy.”

An aide for the House Committee on Labor and Education told Yahoo Finance it’s considering a range of proposals for additional relief for student borrowers.

Kuster told Yahoo Finance she supports student loan relief with or without a pandemic, but the outbreak has presented an opportunity to build support.

“People recognize that student loan debt is one of the things that's holding this next generation back from their full economic potential in their full contribution to our society. As we come out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn, we're going to be looking for opportunities to grow our economy,” said Kuster. “There's broad bipartisan support for increasing the skills, increasing the capacity and removing the barriers to success.”

Democratic lawmakers are also pushing for $13 an hour hazard pay for frontline workers. Sen. Mitt Romney has proposed an extra $12 an hour through the pandemic.

130,"May 6, 2020",Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney,Proposal: Cancel Student Debt for Medical Workers,"Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation that would forgive student loan debt for front-line medical workers.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y), is called the “Student Loan Forgiveness for Frontline Healthcare Workers Act.” Here’s what the bill would do:

The bill would forgive all federal and private student loans for medical workers who are directly working in settings where they are caring for patients suffering from COVID-19.

Covered professions would include front-line doctors, nurses, aids, medical residents, interns and technicians.

The bill would also cover researchers who are working on treatments, cures, and vaccines for COVID-19.

The bill has no cap on student loan forgiveness.

Individual eligibility would be determined by a commission.

The forgiven student loan balance would not be treated as “taxable income” to the borrower.

At a press briefing, Rep. Maloney said, ""We have an obligation to ensure men and women are relieved of the debt they incurred to train for this critical work."" Maloney went on to say that forgiving the student loan debt of front-line medical workers would alleviate fears that many such workers have about leaving their families saddled with their student loan debt if they become sick from COVID-19, or pass away.

This is just the latest proposal for student loan forgiveness offered by lawmakers. Senate Democrats have proposed across-the-board student loan forgiveness of $10,000 per student loan borrower in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. House Democrats went even further, pushing for $30,000 in student loan forgiveness. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has also come out with a plan for student loan forgiveness.","Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation that would forgive student loan debt for front-line medical workers.

131,"May 6, 2020",Deseret News,"Student loan relief under CARES Act a ‘safety net,’ University of Utah grad says","SALT LAKE CITY — Mario Organista, a 2015 University of Utah graduate who carries some $20,000 in student loan debt, says federal relief for borrowers extended under the CARES Act is a “safety net” for his household.

Organista’s wife also has $25,000 to $30,000 in student loan debt, so the assistance provided by the federal legislation was a welcome relief, he said. It means that temporarily, they will have a $400 to $600 a month they can put toward savings, other debt and meeting household needs.

Fortunately, Organista and his wife are both working but he said they are dealing with uncertainty as the economy sputters and there have been record job losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We’re just extremely grateful that this is really helping families like myself, and just not to worry about, having extra cushion is actually creating a safety net for me and my family,” he said.

Organista spoke during a press conference on federal student loan relief conducted Wednesday by Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, at Salt Lake Community College’s South City Campus.

“Congress wanted student borrowers to focus on staying safe and staying healthy, recognizing that this pandemic has created a huge economic hardship for Utah households. We want them to not be worrying about their student loan balance, but instead focus on providing for their families and staying healthy,” said McAdams, who in March spent more than a week hospitalized for treatment after contracting the new coronavirus.

“For recent college graduates carrying federal loans the ... uncertainty of the economic shutdown is stressful and it’s challenging. I recognize that. This relief offers one less financial obligation to juggle as they grappling with such things as child care worries, employment concerns and fears about getting COVID-19,” he said.

For federally held student loans, the legislation automatically reduces interest to 0% and suspends monthly loan payments through Sept. 30. The suspension started on March 13. Eligible borrowers do not have to do anything to receive the relief, he said.

“What we’ve done here is, we’ve provided some additional relief to students and student borrowers who are pursuing public service loan forgiveness,” McAdams said.

Privately held student loans are not eligible for the relief.

Utah college students typically have less student debt than their peers in other states, but approximately 38% of Utah students have some loans to pay off, McAdams said.

Nationally, the average interest rate on federal student loans is about 5.5% and the typical student loan bill is about $400 monthly.

Alejandra Hernandez, who graduated from the U. in 2016, said as the economy started to slow down, she considered not paying her loans because she was unsure whether she would remain employed in her current job.

Relief extended under the CARES Act has enabled her to focus on saving money and paying off credit card debt.

“This has made such a big difference in my life. It’s the first time getting some sort of relief, and it’s a much needed break for me. Personally, I’ve had a lot of uncertainty in my life jobwise since graduating college,” she said.

Chuck Lepper, Salt Lake Community College’s vice president for student affairs and enrollment, expressed gratitude on behalf of student loan borrowers across the state.

“They are tremendously grateful and appreciative of this relief that’s being provided through the forbearance of student loans and interest until Sept. 30. It’s all on behalf of all educators in the state of Utah I want to express my gratitude and thanks and appreciation and advocacy for our students in Utah for this great opportunity to have some relief during this crisis,” Lepper said.

Eligible borrowers are those with federally-held student loans, such as Direct Loans, Family Federal Education Loans, Perkins Loans, Parent Plus and Grad Plus.

Borrowers who can afford it can continue making payments or even making extra payments. During this period the entire payment will go toward principal, helping them pay off their debt faster.

The CARES Act also halts all involuntary collection of federal student loan debt, including wage garnishment and tax refund offset. It also halts negative credit reporting relating to federal student loans.

132,"May 6, 2020",The Cornell Daily Sun,NY Representative Introduces Bill To Eliminate Student Loan Debt of Frontline Healthcare Workers with Weill Cornell Dean,"Medical professions are typically plagued with high rates of burnout, with over half of physicians and one-third of nurses experiencing exhaustion and general frustration that results from long term stress — and the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated these feelings.

A new piece of legislation now aims to alleviate this stress by forgiving frontline health workers student loan debt.

On May 5, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) introduced the Student Loan Forgiveness for Frontline Workers Act, which would forgive the loans acquired to receive medical and professional training of medical workers directly involved in COVID-19 patient care.

“One of the most crucial problems confronting us is the shortage of personnel and the exhaustion of the personel. The physical and emotional strain on staff is drastic,” Maloney said in a Zoom call introducing the legislation.

Maloney represents New York’s 12th district, which includes Weill Cornell Medicine and the NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing. Maloney was joined by Dr. Augustine M.K. Choi, Weill Cornell Dean, in the Zoom call.

“We really applaud you for recognizing the dedication and commitment and service of our frontline healthcare workers around the country who have committed themselves to providing the best care to our patients in need by introducing this fabulous bill,” Choi said.

The bill includes the vast array of medical professionals involved in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Maloney specifically named doctors, nurses and healthcare professions in emergency rooms and intensive care units in addition to the medical students, residents and interns who have put their education on hold to bolster the workforce. The bill also provides a pathway for other healthcare professionals to apply for loan forgiveness.

Weill Cornell is no stranger to trying to financially support its students with staggering amounts of debt. In September 2019, Weill Cornell eliminated all student debt for medical students that qualified for financial aid, in an attempt to reduce student loan debt.

The program replaces student loans with scholarship programs that cover tuition, housing and other living expenses. In a similar manner to the bill, the program was established to reduce the financial burden on those dedicated to helping others through medicine.

The bill comes at a time where there is growing concern for the mental health of frontline healthcare workers. A study of over 1,000 healthcare workers in China found that half of these professionals had symptoms of depression, 34 percent reported insomnia, 44.1 percent reported anxiety and nearly three-quarters of professionals reported distress. Maloney cited the recent suicides of Dr. Lorna Breen ’92 M.S. ’21 and New York City EMT John Mundella as examples of the mounting mental health concerns.

A number of groups, including the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Medical Association, American Federation of Teachers and the Association of American Medical Colleges endorsed the legislation. Randi Weingarten ’80, an alumna of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, is the president of the AFT. David Skorton, the current president and CEO of the AAMC, served as Cornell’s president from 2006 to 2015.","A new piece of legislation now aims to alleviate this stress by forgiving frontline health workers student loan debt.

Another House bill, which was proposed in March, included widespread student loan forgiveness capped at $30,000, which some say is not enough, as medical students on average owe approximately $200,000 according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.

135,"May 5, 2020",The New York Times,Navient Agrees to Settle Teachers’ Loan Forgiveness Lawsuit,"To end a lawsuit brought by a group of teachers, Navient, one of the nation’s largest student loan servicers, has agreed to alter its practices for identifying and guiding public service workers seeking to use a long-troubled loan forgiveness program.

Navient and educators backed by the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation’s largest unions, said in a court filing late last month that they had agreed to settle a lawsuit brought in 2018 in federal court in Manhattan.

The suit centered on the notoriously troubled public service loan forgiveness program. It’s supposed to aid people who work in vital but often low-paying government or nonprofit jobs by allowing them to have their remaining education debt eliminated after a decade of work and loan payments.

But a gantlet of complex rules has disqualified nearly all of those seeking relief. Just 3,200 of the program’s 146,000 applicants have had their loan forgiveness approved, according to the latest Education Department data.","To end a lawsuit brought by a group of teachers, Navient, one of the nation’s largest student loan servicers, has agreed to alter its practices for identifying and guiding public service workers seeking to use a long-troubled loan forgiveness program.

136,"May 5, 2020",ABC News,New bill would forgive medical school debt for COVID-19 health workers,"A lawmaker from a COVID-battered state has introduced a bill to forgive student loan debt for health care workers treating patients on the coronavirus front line, many of whom still owe hundreds of thousands of dollars from medical school.

The legislation comes in response to doctors and nurses speaking out against hazard pay, a 50% bonus Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed the federal government give front-line workers for risking their lives during the pandemic.

""Essential public workers are the ones on the front lines every day carrying us through this crisis,"" Cuomo said in April. ""We must ensure their efforts and sacrifice are appropriately recognized.""

But a 50% bonus won't go far for many young doctors, who on average leave medical school with $200,000 in debt, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.

""I'm looking at a student loan debt of $318,000,"" Dr. Manuel Penton III, age 32, previously told ABC News. ""That few extra thousand dollars, while it may make a big difference to some people, for me, most of that money is going to go back into paying off my student loan debt.""

The idea is catching on. Last month, more than 500,000 people signed a MoveOn petition asking Congress to include student loan debt forgiveness for doctors in the next stimulus bill.

At the same time, dozens of health care organizations, including the American Medical Association, the country's largest association of physicians, wrote a letter to Congress last month asking for student loan forgiveness of at least $20,000 for residents and early graduated medical students whose debt averages over $200,000. The AMA has also endorsed The Student Loan Forgiveness for Frontline Health Workers Act.

The Student Loan Forgiveness for Frontline Health Workers Act, which Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., introduced Tuesday, goes even further.

If passed, the bill would forgive all federal and private student loans for medial professionals who are directly interacting with COVID-19 patients, including front-line doctors, nurses, aids, medical residents, interns and technicians. It would also apply to researchers working on COVID-19 treatments and cures.

""We own more than thanks and cheers at 7 p.m.,"" Maloney said during a Tuesday press briefing. ""We have an obligation to ensure men and women are relieved of the debt they incurred to train for this critical work.""

A House bill proposed in March included more widespread student loan forgiveness, but capped it at $30,000 and was applied only to public loans. A targeted approach aimed at doctors and nurses would be more likely to pass, Maloney said.

The new bill would have no cap on debt relief granted, and any final determinations on individuals' eligibility would be determined by a commission.

In addition to supporting front-line doctors and nurses, Maloney said that offering loan forgiveness could help address medical worker shortages in hard-hit COVID-19 hotspots like New York City. Debt forgiveness would also alleviate the fear doctors and nurses have about dying from COVID-19 and leaving their families to pay off six-figure debts.

A number of Penton's colleagues in Brooklyn have been infected with COVID-19. Two have died.

""There are so many emotions that go along with that,"" Penton said. ""We can't go to the funerals. I can't even find where the gravesite is. There is no sense of closure.""

Maloney also spoke about the tragic deaths of an emergency room doctor and an EMT, both of whom died by suicide last month after treating an overwhelming number of COVID-19 patients.

""We need to do more to support them,"" she said.

On March 13, he announced the interest on student loans would be waived “until further notice” and on March 20 he took things a step further by suspending student loan payments until September 30, 2020.

If you have questions about what this could mean for your student loans, keep reading. Below are some answers to the biggest questions surrounding these new measures.

How to take advantage of the student loan interest waiver

There are several ways that you can take advantage of waiving interest on student loans. For one, as explained above, you can continue to make payments on your loans interest-free. However, you have other options available to you, as well. They are as follows:

Refinancing

For another, now is a good time to consider refinancing. Student loan interest rates are incredibly low right now, thanks to multiple rate cuts. If you can refinance, it may make sense to lock in at an affordable rate and lower your monthly payment.

Public student loan forgiveness

In addition, those trying for public student loan forgiveness will be pleased to know that, even if they pause their student loan payments for the allowed six-month period, those payments will still be counted towards the required 120 monthly federal student loan payments. Since the legislation is so new, your lender may not have updated information on this yet, but it’s a smart idea to keep checking back for updates.WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PERSON YOU COSIGNED FOR DOESN'T PAY?

Income-driven repayment plans

As with public student loan forgiveness, even if you pause your payments during coronavirus, they will count towards your 20 or 25 years or payments, which are required under your income-driven repayment plan.

Which student loans qualify for suspension and waivers?

The suspension and waivers only apply to student loans that are owned by the federal government. This means that if you have private student loans, as well as some Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) and Perkins Loans, they may not qualify.

REFINANCE STUDENT LOANS NOW AND YOU'LL LIKELY SAVE MONEY — HERE'S WHY

If you’re not sure if your federal loans are eligible, your best bet is to talk to your loan servicer to talk about your options. If you’re currently having trouble making your payments, it may make sense to try to consolidate your non-qualifying loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan, which does fall under federal jurisdiction.

Those with private student loans should also know that the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act does allow your employer to help pay up to $5,250 of your student loans this year. If you’re struggling to make your payments, it may be worth contacting your loan servicer to discuss that option.

How this affects your student loans

If you are able to keep making payments on your student loans during this time, it makes financial sense to do so. While these measures will not change the amount that you’re expected to pay monthly toward your student loans, they will affect how your payment is allocated, which can save you money in the long run.

5 STUDENT LOAN MISTAKES THAT CAN COST YOU THOUSANDS

Essentially, every time you make a payment toward your loans, a portion of that payment goes to paying the interest that has accrued on the loan and the remainder goes to paying down the principal loan amount, or the amount that you’ve borrowed.

Since no new interest is accruing on your loans during this period, you have a chance to get ahead. If you keep making payments on your loans, a portion of your payment will go toward paying down any previously-accrued interest and then the remainder will go toward your principal loan amount.

Over time, you’ll be able to pay down more of your principal balance than you would have if interest had kept accruing, which means you’ll be able to pay off your student loans faster.","In an effort to bring aid to those struggling during the coronavirus crisis, President Trump has taken significant measures to ease the burden of student loan payments on borrowers.

They are pursuing their calling and jobs selflessly, yet are appropriately concerned not just about themselves but about not being there for their families. Many don’t have adequate insurance, and don’t solely have federal student loans: While federal loans are discharged after death, private student loans are not. Which is why Congress should pass legislation granting death benefits and educational debt relief for front-line health care workers.

Much has been written about the sacrifice that health care providers are making to care for patients suffering from COVID-19. Doctors updating their wills and sleeping away from their families to reduce risk of exposure. Nurses going to the bedside of patients, concerned about staffing levels, lack of adequate protective equipment, and exposure to the disease. Emergency medical works overwhelmed with cases in the field. Housekeeping staff keeping virus-laden rooms clean. Yet the question medical residents are asking cuts to the core of the heroism and tragedy the medical community is facing: Will there be death payments to their family and relief of their student debt if they die while fighting COVID-19?

This would not be done during normal periods of practice but only under these historic circumstances. There are precedents in other domains to which this pandemic response has been compared. The military has increased death gratuity payments for combat, and forms of debt relief. Police, firefighters, and other first responders have death and survivor benefits for those killed in the line of duty. A Public Safety Officer’s Benefits Program, administered by the Department of Justice, provides monetary compensation and educational benefits to survivors. A similar program should be considered for health workers who die fighting COVID-19. It could be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.

After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the World Trade Center Volunteer Fund was established to provide benefits to volunteers who incurred health-related illness from their work in the rescue, search, and recovery. In addition, the Victim Compensation Fund had provisions for rescuers and first responders. The fund was reactivated by the federal government in 2011, and the “Never Forget the Heroes” Permanent Authorization Act was signed into law last year to extend and ensure continued access for claimants. Mechanisms for professional fund oversight and identification for fraudulent claims are rigorous. In the current medical crisis, exposure information and claims could be verified through hospitals and health systems.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 9,200 health care workers have been infected with COVID-19. Of this number, thought to be a substantial underestimate, 60 percent reported having contact with a COVID-19 patient in the health care setting within the prior two weeks. Among these, there were at least 184 intensive care admissions and 27 deaths. The Minnesota state health department reports up to 28 percent of COVID-19 cases are health care workers. In Ohio, early this week, 18 percent of health care workers were infected. In Massachusetts, more than 6,500 front-line health care workers have jobs that put them at increased risk of exposure, and over 1,600 hospital workers have tested positive for COVID-19. In Italy, over 130 doctors, nurses and nurses aides are dead so far. These numbers reflect limited testing and are rising by the day. While not all cases are necessarily acquired on the job, health care workers are at increased risk, with more severe cases, due to close, prolonged proximity to greater concentrations of the virus.

There is also a compelling case for forgiving remaining medical educational debt for those who die fighting this scourge, especially for those who had barely begun to practice. Legislation should be introduced to guarantee this. The average medical student debt exceeds $200,000; the average nursing school debt is approximately $20,000.

The total amount of funding would be justified, consonant with analogous funding for the fallen heroes of other national disasters, and would not be prohibitive, even with the present economic losses, alongside the government-allocated COVID-19 stimulus/support funds. (It should be noted that the other funds to be allocated for hospitals and medical systems are to mitigate tremendous operating losses for the hospitals and to allow them to survive and continue to battle the pandemic.)

It is the least we can do to honor, compensate, and remember fallen health care workers, and their families. It would bring at least some peace of mind to those who are bravely coming into the hospital for their shifts, being called on to possibly make the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf as this historic plague spreads across our nation.

If you’re hoping for a quick recovery from the Covid-19-driven economic collapse, we’ve got good news and bad news. The good news is that we’ve studied the Great Recession and singled out a crucial factor in how fast the economy can recover: debt relief. The bad news is that, right now, Washington isn’t taking serious action to give people a break on their mortgage and rent payments, student debt, and auto loans.

This crisis did not start in the household sector, but the problems faced by households are similar to 2008. The record 16.8 million new jobless claims already filed have mortgage lenders preparing for the biggest wave of delinquencies in history. By our estimates, more than 30% of all borrowers could default on their mortgage, about 1.5 times the level of defaults during the 2008 crisis. As we learned in that recession, the pain of defaults does not stop with the borrower: The damage creates ripple effects that slow down the economy. Ruined credit scores make it harder for borrowers to get future loans, foreclosed homes fall in value and bring down neighborhood property values, and cities suffer when borrowers have less to spend at local restaurants and businesses.

Washington has to move quickly—right now—because we know from the Great Recession that how we handle debt relief today will critically determine the speed of the recovery. Swift action can prevent the imminent surge of mortgage defaults from spiraling into a prolonged recession.

We analyzed a decade of data and millions of U.S. households following the Great Recession, finding that regions that did not receive household debt relief took about four more years to recover in terms of consumer spending, house prices, and employment than the ones that did. In general, both household debt overhang and the foreclosures that follow mortgage defaults significantly hamper economic activity and slow down economic recovery.

Washington has at least acknowledgedthis need: A major piece of the $2 trillion Cares Act is a mandate that all borrowers with government-backed mortgages—about two-thirds of all mortgages—be allowed to delay at least 90 days of monthly payments and possibly up to a year’s worth. This is an important first step that buys us some time. But it will not be enough and should not be considered a long-term remedy. These deferred payments will need to be made at a later time. Households already distressed, because they lost jobs or income, will have a hard time coming up with the money, when the time comes.

An even more important lesson from the Great Recession is that the method for distributing debt relief is critical. The Cares Act calls for relying on private sector loan servicers—like Wells Fargo and Bank of America—for debt relief. But we cannot and should not rely solely on the private sector, because we have some evidence of how they respond. After the Great Recession, the Obama administration created programs in 2009 designed to encourage banks and lenders to refinance and work out mortgages. But many decided against it anyway because it didn’t align with their incentives: Some mortgage servicrs felt they did not have enough incentives to restructure loans, many banks and lenders felt borrowers didn’t have enough equity, they didn’t see a competitive need to offer refinancing, or they didn’t want to encourage moral hazard. Several simply didn’t have the organizational ability to conduct restructuring on a large scale. The results were discouraging: even though these programs were designed to help 12 million borrowers, barely 5 million were actually able to use them. In fact, loan servicers’ refusal to renegotiate with many borrowers, particularly in the first year of the Great Recession, by itself accounted for upward of two million foreclosures.

At a fundamental level, a bank or investor’s balance sheet doesn’t reflect the positive impact of an unemployed airline or hotel worker keeping their home and being able to spend more freely. Nor will it reflect the adverse effects to the local economy of foreclosing a home. Banks and lenders have a fiduciary duty to focus on returns for their investors. Left to implement programs on their own, they’re not likely to achieve the level of debt relief that the U.S. needs right now. And under the Cares Act, banks and loan servicers are now required to make up any shortfall in payments in the interim. Just like in the aftermath of the Great Recession, banks and lenders will have the wrong incentives if we want them to help borrowers with their mortgage payment.

Vulnerable households need permanent and quick debt relief. Washington can help directly. The easiest and cheapest approach would be to leave debt balances intact and instead forgive or take over the interest payments on debt, including mortgages, credit cards, and student loan debt. Since federal and state governments mandated the stay-at-home orders creating this downturn, it is only reasonable that taxpayers should pick up the tab. A good policy would start by forgiving six months of interest—and working directly with borrowers rather than relying on lenders for implementation. A reevaluation of the length can be done later when we have a clearer picture of the severity of the crisis.

Renters, by definition, do not make interest payments and unfortunately wouldn’t benefit. Washington should consider a special housing voucher program that offers relief to renters and avoids evictions.

To make sure taxpayers don’t overcommit, the federal government could impose eligibility requirements, targeting relief to those households that have suffered a documented loss of income or financial hardship. By our estimates, a targeted policy could cost up to $100 billion.

Congress should start taking these measures into account when it returns to Washington to start work on the next phase of the economic rescue.If we do not act aggressively and immediately, we risk making the same mistakes that resulted in a prolonged and slow recovery during the last crisis.

141,"Apr 14, 2020",Money,Companies Are Now Getting a Tax Break to Help Employees Pay Down Student Loans During Coronavirus,"Companies have a new incentive to help their employees pay down their student debt.

The incentive—a new tax break—is thanks to a less-highlighted provision in the CARES Act, which also temporarily pauses payments and interest on most federal student loans as part of the government’s efforts to ease the financial chaos caused by the coronavirus.

Employers can now pay up to $5,250 toward an employee’s student loans tax-free through the end of the year. Traditionally, these payments are treated as wages, but until December 31, 2020, these payments are excluded from income and payroll taxes – benefitting both the employer and those receiving the repayment assistance.

Scott Thompson, who runs a company that manages these programs, says he has no doubt this change will accelerate adoption of loan repayment assistance programs by employers, despite the economic impacts of COVID-19.

“While we certainly are dealing with a growing number of economic uncertainties as a result of the virus, we are expecting the percentage [of participating companies] to increase dramatically over the course of the second half of this year and next,” Thompson, CEO of Tuition.io, says.

Thompson points out that industries that are on the frontlines of dealing with the crisis, such as healthcare, are looking to fortify benefits for employees by adding student loan repayment. He is seeing a growing number of clients who are working to launch new student loan benefits later this quarter and early in the second half of the year.

Although the tax exemption is through the end of this year, Thompson says he is confident it will get adopted as a permanent change to the IRS tax code.

How Employer Student Loan Assistance Works

Approximately 8% of employers currently offer student loan payment benefit, which has doubled from 4% in 2018, according to Society for Human Resource Management.

With outstanding U.S. student debt growing daily and totaling roughly $1.7 trillion, companies offer loan repayment assistance to attract and retain college-educated employers.

“It is clear that we have reached a tipping point and student loans are having secondary impacts on many professionals,” says a spokesperson for accounting firm PwC.

PwC has paid more than $37 million toward student loan debt as a result of their program, one of the first of its kind. The benefit pays $1,200 a year for up to six years to help associates and senior associates pay down their student loans.

Estée Lauder has nearly 1,000 full-time employees registered for its student loan assistance program. The company contributes $100 towards eligible employees’ student loans every month, with a $10,000 lifetime maximum contribution, according to a spokesperson for the company.

Chegg, Fidelity Investments, Penguin Random House and Hulu are some of other companies that offer this benefit.

What You Should Know If Your Employer Repays Your Student Loans

Any amount paid by the employer toward interest on the student loans is not eligible for a deduction on your federal taxes. (Borrowers can subtract up to $2,500 in interest paid on student loans from their taxable income.)

“Employers can work around this restriction by targeting their payments to apply just to principal,” says Mark Kantrowitz, Publisher at Savingforcollege.com. “The borrower's payments will then cover the interest and still qualify for the student loan interest deduction.”

Prior to the CARES Act, any money received toward student loans counted as income for the employee. That means you’d normally pay taxes on the amount, and if you had federal student loans in an income-based repayment plan, your monthly payment could increase due to the resulting higher income. Yet for the rest of 2020 (unless the provision is extended) repayment assistance doesn’t count as taxable income, and so neither of those will happen.

How Much (and Who) Do Student Loan Employee Benefit Programs Help?

Even though the temporary tax-law change helps some borrowers, it has critics who say the policy is regressive.

Adam Looney, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, points out that this benefit only helps borrowers who are still employed and who work at companies that offer generous benefits.

He estimates that borrowers in the bottom 40% of the income distribution, who earn less than roughly $42,000 get about 5% of the tax benefit. Those with student loans who are in the top 20% of the income distribution will get nearly half the total benefits.

""Rather than providing relief to distressed borrowers,"" he writes, ""the provision instead showers tax cuts on high-income workers with good jobs.""

142,"Apr 14, 2020",TechCrunch,"College isn’t free yet, but Savi raises a $6M Series A to assist student loan borrowers find loan forgiveness – TechCrunch","The student loan crisis has crescendoed to even worse heights. As universities shut down across the country due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and employment opportunities dim with the rapidly decelerating economy, today’s students and post-grads need better tools than ever to navigate their finances.

Unfortunately, student loans in the United States are extraordinarily complicated, with literally hundreds of variations on loan terms, repayment methods and public interest forgiveness options. For borrowers, what are the best ways to minimize their total burden while staying within the rules?

Washington, DC-based Savi wants to make student loan borrowers “savvy” to the best options available to them, and now it has even more capital to take on this pressing challenge. The company announced today that it has raised a $6 million Series A led by Nyca Partners, one of the most influential investing firms in the fintech space.

Finance startups often have misaligned incentives between users and their own revenue models — a financial health app may make quiet referral revenue by peddling new credit cards and loans, exactly what a user doesn’t need.

What makes Savi interesting is that the company was designed from the beginning to make sure that it always placed the interests of its users first. It’s organized as a public benefit corporation and founded by two idealistic founders who came together over improving the outcomes of the nation’s youth.

After graduating from Georgetown Law, Aaron Smith founded and spent four years running Young Invincibles, a youth-focused think tank and advocacy organization that was originally created to bring attention to youth issues during the healthcare reform discussions in the early years of the Obama administration. Meanwhile, Savi’s other co-founder, Tobin Van Ostern, worked on youth voter engagement for Obama’s first presidential campaign as the head of Students for Barack Obama before heading to the liberal Center for American Progress.

Together, they decided to found Savi to bring their progressive mission orientation to helping young people around student debt. The student loan world is “fairly complicated, and while obviously I think there needs to be continued improvement on the policy side, we needed solutions for student loan borrowers right now,” Smith explained. “And so that was sort of the impetus behind Savi — to use technology to create those kind of solutions.”

Savi ingests student loan data from users and then begins crunching the numbers to calculate the best options for repayment or forgiveness while taking into account the goals of its users.

While student lending is a trillion-dollar-plus market, Savi — owing to its progressive roots — has been particularly focused on offering its platform to users like social workers, teachers and service workers. One of their largest partners is NEA, the largest teachers union in the United States with around 3 million members, and Savi is offered as a benefit to its members.

Organizations offer Savi’s student loan assessment tool to their employees and members to help them understand their financial picture. That tool is free for users, but from there, Savi charges a subscription to actively manage a user’s student loans, such as automating the process for filling out paperwork. Users can calculate their savings using Savi before committing to paying a subscription, ensuring that no user pays if Savi can’t help them save money. The company says that the average borrower sees $140 in savings per month and pays a $5-a-month subscription fee.

Given the typical employment of its users, Savi has a particular specialty on loan forgiveness, an option that many student loans offer for people in public-interest careers. Such options often have byzantine rules for eligibility though, and so Savi works to ensure that borrowers seeking forgiveness stay within the rules of their loan programs. Currently, the company handles more than 150 forgiveness and repayment options.

Similar to its assessment tools for organizations, Savi launched a new tool around COVID-19 to help people in health professions or who have been laid off as a result of the pandemic to figure out their student loan situations and find new programs for help. “We actually happen to have a pretty disproportionately high number of users that actually work on the COVID crisis,” Van Ostern explained.

Startups around managing student loans have been a popular area of investment for VCs. Yesterday, my colleague Alex Wilhelm noted that student loan platform Frank received a $5 million interim strategic round of funding, with edtech giant Chegg taking a board seat. I also covered Summer’s $10 million raise late last year, which, like Savi, is a public benefit corporation focused on minimizing the burden of student loan payments.

In addition to Nyca, Savi received funding from AlleyCorp, Temerity Capital and 9Yards Capital, along with Michelle Kang, Catherine Reynolds and Sheila Lirio Marcelo.","The student loan crisis has crescendoed to even worse heights.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is all but guaranteed to become the Democratic Party’s nominee for president of the United States this fall.

The seasoned politician now hopes to lead the fight to forgive student loans after beefing up his policy proposals for the matter in the wake of firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders‘ exit from the primary race. The plan also includes language specifically for people who attended Historically Black Colleges and Universities, according to Forbes.

“Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I’m proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis,” Biden said in a Medium post.

Biden rolled out the new plan on Thursday that details his desire to forgive federal student tuition-based debt for low-income and middle-class people that attended public institutions, including two- and four-year programs, with some exceptions. Private loans are not included in the policy proposal.

The exceptions to the rule are HBCUs and minority-serving institutions (MSI), which are made up of both public and private colleges. Some of the most recognizable HBCUs, including Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College, are private institutions.

Biden’s new forgiveness plan is directed to individuals who bring home less than $125,000 a year. Those who make less than $25,000 a year would not be asked to make monthly payments on public loans.

The plan is in part a response to the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden said he would pay for the debt cancellation by repealing an “excess business losses” tax cut that was part of the CARES Act, the bipartisan $2.2 trillion stimulus package signed by President Donald Trump last month. More details about the plan will come out in the future.

“That tax cut overwhelmingly benefits the richest Americans and is unnecessary for addressing the current COVID-19 economic relief efforts,” Biden wrote in the proposal.

READ MORE: Biden needs more than a John Lewis endorsement to win young Black voters

Biden’s plan expands on his initial $750 billion policy proposal to address the mounting student debt crisis, which was centered on income-based repayment. Individuals making more than $25,000 would be asked to pay no more than 5% of discretionary income toward loan payments for 20 years. After meeting that obligation, all outstanding federal loan balances would be forgiven.

Biden has also voiced support for canceling at least $10,000 of student debt per person, which he adopted from former presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren‘s coronavirus response proposal.

By contrast, Sen. Sanders has voiced unyielding support for canceling all student debt, including federally backed and private loans.","The seasoned politician now hopes to lead the fight to forgive student loans after beefing up his policy proposals for the matter in the wake of firebrand Sen.

Other private student loan lenders and servicers

Although private student loans aren’t eligible for the same protections that federal loans have, the top student lenders are stepping in to help borrowers pause their payments during this difficult time. Some make it easy to apply online, while others work with borrowers individually over the phone.

To learn more about your options, email or call your loan servicer ASAP. The sooner you ask for help, the sooner you’ll be able to get a break from your private student loan payments.

Just remember that interest will very likely continue to accrue on private student loans, meaning your balance will grow during a period of paused payments. But if you’re facing financial hardship, postponing payments could be exactly what you need right now to navigate this difficult time.

145,"pr 10, 2020",Black Enterprise,"Joe Biden Calls For Student Loan Forgiveness, Medicare Changes","Democratic presidential presumptive nominee Joe Biden released a new plan Thursday to forgive and eliminate student loan debt for millions of student borrowers.

According to Forbes, Biden’s plan would forgive all undergraduate federal student loan debt for borrowers who attended public colleges and universities, historically black colleges and universities, and private minority-serving institutions (MSIs). Borrowers that make less than $125,000 would also be eligible for loan forgiveness.

“I would finance this new student debt proposal by repealing the high-income ‘excess business losses’ tax cut in the CARES Act,” Biden wrote. “That tax cut overwhelmingly benefits the richest Americans and is unnecessary for addressing the current COVID-19 economic relief efforts.”

Additionally, Biden also supports Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s plan to restructure the bankruptcy code allowing student loan debt to be easily discharged in bankruptcy. Currently, student loan debt is treated differently from other forms of consumer debt in bankruptcy. Many feel that it’s time-consuming and difficult to meet the difficult “undue hardship” standard needed.

Biden’s new plan goes further than a previous plan he released last year. Political analysts see the new plan as an olive branch to align supporters of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and to consolidate the Democratic base.

Biden also released a plan to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from January 2019 almost 90% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans believe citizens as young as 50 should be allowed to buy into Medicare.

“It reflects the reality that, even after the current crisis ends, older Americans are likely to find it difficult to secure jobs,” Biden wrote of the plan. He added the plan would be financed “out of general revenues to protect the Medicare Trust Fund.”

Biden also supported a $10,000 federal student loan forgiveness plan as a response to the coronavirus outbreak. Senate Democrats proposed this idea, but Senate Republicans eliminated it from the final version of the CARES Act.

College students and the elderly are among the most impacted by the outbreak. College students were forced to rush off campus quickly and the elderly have been told in some states not to go outside. Luckily both have received some help. U-Haul provided free storage for students and celebrities have reached out to the elderly.","Democratic presidential presumptive nominee Joe Biden released a new plan Thursday to forgive and eliminate student loan debt for millions of student borrowers.

As the coronavirus pandemic has changed the world in many seen and unseen ways, nursing students across the country have been left dealing with the practical realities of how a global pandemic impacts their daily lives. Some students have seen their education extended by an entire semester, while others are facing graduation earlier than expected.

What hasn’t changed about nursing school, however, is the cost. Those student loans still have to get paid, right? Whether you’re out in the workforce, looking at graduating early, or still have more school to complete, here are some of the ways you can get help with your student loan payments in the wake of COVID-19.

Federal Student Loan Deferment

If you have federal student loans, we have good news: you don’t have to do anything to take advantage of reduced interest and suspending payments. As of right now, it’s all automatically applied to all federal student loans, thanks to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which went into effect March 27th.

The U.S. Department of Education has reduced the interest rate on all federal loans to 0% from now until September 30, 2020. This interest rate reduction will take place automatically and applies to loans in all states--including if you’re still in school, if your loans are in a grace period, in repayment, or in deferment/forbearance.

In addition to the 0% interest rate, all federal loans are also automatically being placed into administrative forbearance, which means monthly payments are suspended. The administrative forbearance is also in effect until Sept. 30, 2020. If for some reason, you had a direct deposit that was set up and still went through, or you paid without realizing that you didn’t have to, you can also request a refund of any payments made between March 27th and September 30, 2020. However, if you want to make payment during this time, you absolutely can and the Department of Ed notes that any payments made during the 0% interest time will be applied to the principal once all your loan’s interest amount prior to March 13 is paid.

If you’re on a Public Loan Forgiveness plan, which requires you to work full-time and make qualifying monthly loan payments in order to reach the forgiveness, you will receive credit towards the forgiveness as if you were making your monthly payments. And the same goes for anyone on an income-driven repayment plan--suspended payments will still count towards forgiveness.

You can also check on the Federal Student Aid COVID-19 website for updates and FAQs about your federal loans.

Private Student Loan Deferment

Unfortunately, lenders who offer private loans are under no obligation to follow federal rules and regulations on offering forbearance or 0% interest rates during the pandemic. Unlike federal lenders, private lenders set their own rules and rates, which means that if you have a private loan, you are subject to their conditions.

However, if you are a nurse or nursing student struggling to make your monthly payments, there are still some steps you can take with a private lender:

Check if your lender has issued any public response to COVID-19. Some lenders, such as WellsFargo and Sallie Mae have released public responses to COVID-19, outlining what resources they are offering to borrowers. You can check on their website or speak with a representative.

Call your loan officer and see if they’re willing to work with you. Explain your financial situation and how COVID-19 has impacted you.

Ask about loan assistance programs. There are many options that a lender may be able to offer you on an individual basis, such as suspending payments for a few months, temporarily lowering your interest rate, or offering interest-only payments.

Student Loan Refinance

If deferring your student loans isn't an option at the moment, refinancing your loans is a good alternative. Refinancing is the process of replacing your loan's current interest rate with a new interest rate. This process works best when current interest rates are lower than when you originally opened your loan, saving you money by reducing your monthly payments. Some refinancing options also let you consolidate all your student loans into one new loan, making things easier to keep track of. If you're currently working and generating income, you could qualify for a student loan refinance.

Other Ways to Get Financial Support Right Now

Outside of loan forgiveness, the American Association of Colleges of Nurses also recently announced a COVID-19 Nursing Student Support Fund of $25,000 for nursing students. The Support Fund is providing 50 $500 one-time grants to nursing students for educational and/or life expenses who are enrolled in AACN member schools. According to the AACN, students in their final two semesters will be given priority.

Interested full-time students can apply online for the Support Fund by April 27. The application will include:

Any opinions, analyses, reviews or recommendations expressed in this article are those of the author’s alone, and may not have been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by the financial institution.

The coronavirus outbreak is impacting the economy, and college students aren’t spared from the effects. While many schools have sent students to live off campus or back home to their families, this doesn’t seem to have eased expenses for everyone. Likewise, job losses are adding to many students’ hardships.

Student Loan Hero surveyed more than 1,000 college and university students to learn about how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their finances, academics and post-graduation career plans. Here’s what the data showed.

Key findings

More than 4 out of 5 (81%) of college students surveyed said they are facing financial difficulties due to the coronavirus crisis, with more than a quarter having trouble paying bills or feeding themselves. (Read more)

Student loan borrowers are facing a higher level of financial difficulties than their peers. (Read more)

Most students want at least partial student loan forgiveness from the government. (Read more)

More than 4 out of 5 students facing financial challenges

Amid the economic collapse from the coronavirus outbreak, nearly 47% of college students said they’ve experienced a loss of income, and about 26% reported either food insecurity or trouble paying bills. Of those having trouble paying bills, most (71%) were especially concerned about rent.

Black and Hispanic students reported a much higher level of food and housing insecurity due to the COVID-19 pandemic than their white peers. Specifically, 33% of black students were having trouble covering food costs, and 22% struggled with housing expenses. In those same categories, the figures were 36% and 18% respectively, for Hispanic students. By comparison, 21% of white students reported suffering from food insecurity, and 14% faced housing issues.

Student loan borrowers were also facing a heightened level of financial stress than their debt-free peers, with 31% worried about paying bills compared to 19% among the debt-free group. And while nearly 43% of all college students are worried for their parents’ financial situation, that number rose to nearly 47% among student loan borrowers.

Students still face high costs despite taking classes online

With college campuses closing across the country, many students have left school grounds to continue their studies remotely.

According to our survey, about 68% of college students have gone back home, while an additional 22% are living off campus. About 59% of students will be taking classes online for the rest of the semester, while 36% said their online learning is still considered a temporary measure at this point.

But despite the transition to off-campus learning, almost half of students (49%) say their college expenses haven’t been reduced in any way.

On the other hand, about 13% of those surveyed were able to return some student loan money because they no longer needed to pay for housing or a meal plan. And nearly 1 in 4 said they expect to receive a refund from their school for housing and meal costs.

Over one-third of students taking on debt to deal with the crisis

With many students having to leave campus due to the COVID-19 outbreak, it’s not surprising that 1 in 4 has lost their job. An additional 24% were able to keep their jobs but said their hours were cut.

To cope with these losses, more than one-third of students (36%) are taking on debt. Over 17% reported amassing credit card debt, and 16% said they had to borrow additional student loans.

Student loan borrowers (47%) were more likely to take on additional debt than those without student loans (19%). And students who identified as either black or Hispanic were much more likely to be taking on debt (48%) than white students (29%).

Majority of students want student loan forgiveness from the government

In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government passed the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act” (CARES Act). Among the education provisions, the legislation has paused interest charges on federal student loans for six months and offered to halt payments for that time period for whomever needs it.

But the majority of students in this survey (77%) felt the government should go farther by automatically forgiving a portion of all borrowers’ student loans to deal with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. This number was higher among women than men (81% versus 74%) and highest among student loan borrowers (84%).

Students are anxious about academics and job prospects

Along with their financial anxieties, students are also stressed about academics and their job prospects following graduation.

More than half of those surveyed said they feared their learning would be hindered without in-person classes, and 30% were worried their grades would suffer. At the same time, nearly 14% were concerned they didn’t have access to the technology they needed to get their work done, and almost 12% said they were stressed they wouldn’t get to complete an internship.

Almost half (49%) of graduating seniors think the pandemic will impact their chances of finding a job after graduation. And nearly 51% of all students said they felt less prepared to enter the workforce because of the coronavirus pandemic.

In fact, 72% of graduating seniors said the COVID-19 crisis had already impacted their post-graduation plans. Among students in their final year of college, 26% said they had decided to move back home due to the pandemic, while 19% had decided to pursue a different career path, and 28% said their plans had changed in some other way.

Finding relief during the coronavirus pandemic

If you’re a college student experiencing financial stress due to the COVID-19 crisis, these resources could help:

Fortunately, anyone with federal student loans can find some relief, thanks to the CARES Act, which — as mentioned above — offers six months of 0% interest and allows you to pause to your repayments interest-free.

Borrowers with private student loans, meanwhile, should contact their loan servicer to find out about options if they need to pause payments.

148,"Apr 24, 2020",The Pew Charitable Trusts,Millions of Federal Student Loan Borrowers Lack Access to Immediate Repayment Help,"The novel coronavirus has already taken a significant societal and economic toll, and the long-term effects on families’ balance sheets are only beginning to be understood. Importantly, the spread of COVID-19 has created challenges for student loan borrowers and servicers, the companies hired by the U.S. Department of Education to collect and help borrowers manage their payments.

Many borrowers, for example, are facing temporary or long-term loss of a paycheck. They could become sick or need to care for ill family members. Servicers, meanwhile, are experiencing coronavirus-related disruptions such as staffing shortages and high call volumes from affected borrowers.

The federal government has taken quick steps to provide support, but millions of borrowers are finding that they are not eligible for programs intended to ease their financial troubles. In many cases, that is because of the kind of loans they have.

In response to the emerging pandemic, the Trump administration acted in March to specifically help borrowers. Congress, meanwhile, passed a bipartisan coronavirus relief bill that, among its many provisions, provides additional resources to the office of Federal Student Aid, which oversees most federal student loan servicers, and repayment assistance for federal student loan borrowers.

The legislation automatically paused payments and interest charges for borrowers repaying their loans and stopped collection efforts through Sept. 30, 2020, for those who have defaulted. But many cannot take advantage of these provisions because the protections in the stimulus bill are available only to borrowers whose loans are owned by the Department of Education. Although that includes all with direct loans, many with older loans from discontinued lending programs are excluded.

For example, some Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans are “commercially held,” meaning they are owned by private banks and lenders but insured against default by the Department of Education. Approximately 6 million of the 43 million borrowers with federal loans—with a total value of about $140 billion—fall into this category. Additionally, 1.9 million borrowers owe around $6 billion in Perkins loans, which are federally subsidized but generally owned by colleges. These loans also are not eligible for the new protections.

Borrowers with commercially held FFEL Program loans may be able to get assistance from their lenders, but it is neither automatic nor as comprehensive as that provided by the coronavirus relief bill. That means these borrowers may face an increased likelihood of missing payments or defaulting on their debt.

In addition, inconsistencies in repayment terms for borrowers with federal loans could make interactions between borrowers and servicers more complex at a time of disruption and distress—and in a system already in need of streamlining. In forthcoming focus group research by The Pew Charitable Trusts, borrowers speak of difficulties navigating the repayment system when the economy was functioning much better than it is now. A growing body of research from federal agencies, academics, think tanks, and advocates reflects similar challenges.

Unequal access to repayment assistance drives negative outcomes

Although borrowers have different types of federal loans with different terms, many experience comparable barriers to repayment. In addition, borrowers’ loans are managed by the same servicers, and they are similarly vulnerable to problems attributable to the coronavirus. Millions have seen their jobs evaporate, and many may now be sick or need to care for family members who are ill.

Importantly, those borrowers with commercially held FFEL Program loans did not choose to have their loans held by a private entity. In fact, some also have federal loans held by the Department of Education. Providing repayment protections based on the holder of the debt may leave some borrowers confused about whether payments are due on some or all of their loans. If borrowers think they are eligible for new protections but are not, they may fail to make payments and could become delinquent or default on their loans.

Servicers of student loans also face significant pressures at a time when these borrowers most need their assistance. These companies may be experiencing staffing disruptions, limited call center availability, or other problems while many borrowers are seeking their help.

Whatever the reason, failing to repay a federal student loan can have serious financial consequences for borrowers, regardless of who holds the debt. They can face collection fees; wage garnishment; money being withheld from income tax refunds, Social Security, and other federal payments; damage to their credit scores; and even ineligibility for other aid programs, such as help with homeownership. Meanwhile, the risk is more limited for lenders. When borrowers with commercially-held FFEL Program loans default, the Department of Education pays loan holders almost the full value of the defaulted debt.

Extending the same repayment assistance to all federal student loan borrowers would involve additional considerations and complexity—and require alternative solutions. For example, holders of commercially-held federal student loans may want to provide protections to borrowers similar to those in the stimulus legislation, but they may be limited by investment and contractual agreements.

Still, Congress has a history of helping borrowers weather difficult economic times and can take additional steps to make sure all federal borrowers have access to flexible, affordable repayment options. For example, industry groups and consumer advocates have urged lawmakers to provide interest subsidies, among other benefits, for those with commercially-held FFEL Program and Perkins loans in future legislation. Such action would help many vulnerable Americans avoid delinquency or default during this period of national and personal distress.

149,"Apr 24, 2020",The Motley Fool,Do You Have Too Many Student Loans?,"Taking out student loans can become an issue, however, if you end up borrowing more than you can pay back or more than you should. If you find yourself taking out tons of student loans, you could end up in a difficult financial situation in which your debt impedes your other goals.

Borrowing to afford an education is common. And, since many student loans are low-rate loans with long repayment timelines and ample borrower protections, it's not a big problem in most situations.

How to determine if you're taking on too much student debt

There's no one right answer when considering how much student debt is too much, largely because this depends on earning potential. If your degree opens the door to a six-figure salary as soon as you graduate, it will obviously be more affordable for you to borrow a lot than someone in another profession who will have a hard time cracking a $50,000 salary.

One rule of thumb is to consider what your starting salary is likely to be and aim to keep your loan balance under that amount. So if your degree will enable you to enter a profession in which you're likely to start at $30,000, you wouldn't want to borrow more than that.

You might also consider what your payments are likely to be after graduation, based on your final debt balance.

Say, for example, you're likely to end up with $25,000 in loans at 5% interest with a 10-year repayment period. Your monthly payment would be about $265 per month. If you earn $25,000, that's about 13% of your household income. If you figure you're spending 30% of your income on housing, 10% on health insurance, 15% on transportation, 13% on taxes, and 10% on food, that would leave you with about 9% for everything else, including savings.

It's doable, but would leave you little money to save or spend on anything fun. If you had a roommate and lowered your housing costs, or your salary increased in time, you'd probably be fine. But if you took out $50,000 in loans on that $25,000 salary, you'd be in trouble.

You can choose income-driven plans for federal student loans that limit your monthly payment and free up cash, but these plans stretch your payments out over 20 or 25 years. Committing to being in debt for such a long time is often a bad idea, because it can interfere with your efforts to do other things with your money.

What should you do if you have tons of student loans?

If you've already taken on a lot of student loan debt, you do have options.

If you work in a public service job and have federal student loans, make sure you're working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness. This program allows you to get loans forgiven after making 120 on-time payments on a qualifying income-driven repayment plan.

If you're struggling to pay federal loans, you can also explore income-driven repayment plans that cap your monthly payments as a percentage of income. After 20 to 25 years, depending on the plan, any outstanding balance will be forgiven. As mentioned above, stretching out repayment for so long isn't ideal -- but it's better than struggling for a decade, or risking missed payments.

Finally, you can refinance loans with a private student loan refinance lender. If you have federal loans, this often isn't a good idea, because private loans aren't as flexible in allowing you to pause or lower your payments if you're struggling, and there are no forgiveness options for private loans. But you can often lower the rate with private loans, and sometimes on federal loans if you don't plan to take advantage of any federal borrower protections.

Be smart about how you borrow for school

If you have to borrow to fund your education, you want to take on the minimum debt necessary to earn a degree that can help you improve your income. If you find you're borrowing more than you can reasonably pay back, or if you're taking out loans for non-essential spending while in school, it's time to take a step back and reconsider your actions. You don't want to commit your future self to a debt payback schedule that won't work for your budget.","Taking out student loans can become an issue, however, if you end up borrowing more than you can pay back or more than you should.
And, since many student loans are low-rate loans with long repayment timelines and ample borrower protections, it's not a big problem in most situations.

Federal, direct student loans are automatically in forbearance due to the coronavirus pandemic, and won't take automatic payments until the period ends on September 30, 2020.

If your income has been unaffected, you can pay your loans during this time, but you have to call your loan servicer and make arrangements to do so.

Student loan expert Travis Hornsby says most people probably shouldn't choose to pay their loans anyway, especially if you're using an income driven repayment plan or a public service loan forgiveness program.

For many middle- and low-income Americans, putting money into an emergency fund or towards high-interest credit card debt might make more sense than paying down student loans right now.

If you have private student loans that don't offer any payment relief, consider refinancing to a lower rate »

Coronavirus and rising unemployment figures have meant big changes to student loans.

Federal student loans are automatically in forbearance right now. The forbearance, which temporarily postpones student loan payments and has dropped interest rates to 0%, started March 13 and will last through September 30, 2020.

Any federal, direct student loan borrowers should see that automatic payments have stopped, and any payments made since March 13 can be refunded by calling your loan servicer.

Loans issued through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, like Parent PLUS loans or Stafford loans, won't receive automatic forbearance. Private student loans are not in forbearance — borrowers must still make payments as usual, although some lenders are making accommodations for people affected by the pandemic.

It's still possible to make payments right now, if you have stable work and plan to repay your loans in full. Through September, any extra payments will go directly to the principal of the loan, lowering the amount used to calculate interest. Though automatic payments have been suspended on federal loans, contact your student loan servicer to make payments if you wish.

It might sound like a great opportunity to take advantage of that 0% interest and make ""extra"" payments on your loans, if you can afford it. But, student loan expert and founder of Student Loan Planner Travis Hornsby says for most people, now is not the time to worry about getting ahead on student loan payments.

If you're on an income-driven repayment plan or in a public service loan forgiveness program, there's no reason to pay

""Please don't make extra payments right now,"" Hornsby wrote in an email to the Student Loan Planner community on April 9.

That's because, for anyone using an income driven repayment plan (IDR) or a public service loan forgiveness program (PSLF), paying on your student loan during the forbearance period won't help you get ahead any faster. These programs, which both require an application process, forgive loans after a set number of months. The six months during the loan forbearance period will count toward that total for anyone on this plan, whether or not you make a payment.

""If you were in IDR prior to March 13, any suspended payments between that date and September 30 count for loan forgiveness,"" Hornsby wrote.

If you expect your loans to make it to forgiveness, there's no reason to try and make a payment during the coronavirus-caused forbearance period. ""You don't get gold stars for making extra payments right now,"" Hornsby wrote.

If you're not on a repayment plan, you may still want to skip payments

Hornsby thinks most Americans would be better off paying off expensive credit card debt and building an emergency fund while student loan payments are suspended, two choices that could help protect them financially should they lose their job and income.

""A typical person, like a $30,000 student loan borrower, probably has like a middle-class income, and would probably be at a greater risk of being laid off,"" Hornsby told Business Insider in a follow-up conversation.

Building an emergency fund, a savings account of several months worth of expenses, will help avoid high interest debt if you lose your income or get sick. ""In the worst recession since maybe the Great Depression , when everybody's losing their jobs, it seems smarter to hold on to some money just in case,"" he said.

Plus, although many banks are offering short-term payment deferrals and other accommodations for people unable to pay their credit card bill, credit card debt is still accumulating interest right now, and balances still affect credit scores like normal. ""There are no negative credit events going on with this 0% student loan interest. It's going to reflect in your credit score, carrying credit card debt,"" Hornsby said.

If you have paid, you can get a refund

Anyone can get money back that was paid towards federal student loans right now, repayment plan or not.

If you've paid your student loans but could use the money, you can get refunds if your loan qualifies. According to the Federal Student Aid website, ""Any auto-debit payments processed between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, can be refunded to you.""

Getting a refund on your payment if you need it back should be as easy as picking up the phone and calling your loan servicer. ""In most every situation I'm seeing, people are getting a refund processed within a two- to six-week time frame,"" Hornsby wrote in his initial email.","If you have private student loans that don't offer any payment relief, consider refinancing to a lower rate »Coronavirus and rising unemployment figures have meant big changes to student loans.

151,"Apr 23, 2020",Christian Science Monitor,Hope for student borrowers: Settlement requires administration move faster,"For Ms. Sweet, the settlement “feels like a huge victory.” But even if her federal loans are forgiven tomorrow, she says, “I’m still starting from scratch.”

She is the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit that reached a proposed settlement this month with the agency, which has agreed to a firm 18-month deadline for processing such claims. The compromise represents one step of progress while the larger question continues to play out: What’s the fairest way to satisfy the rights of misled borrowers while ensuring that students, colleges, and the government all fulfill their respective responsibilities?

How should the government help students defrauded by for-profit colleges? A lawsuit is pushing the Education Department to act more quickly on loan forgiveness – and raising questions about accountability and fairness.

By the time Ms. Sweet graduated in 2006, she says the only photography jobs available were unpaid. She has worked in sales and as a nursing assistant ever since. In 2016, she filed a “borrower defense” claim that would qualify her for loan forgiveness, and has been waiting for an answer from the U.S. Department of Education.

When Theresa Sweet enrolled in the Brooks Institute of Photography in California, she didn’t realize the school had been bought out by a for-profit company. Two years into a program that required Ms. Sweet to take out $46,000 in federal loans, Brooks came under investigation for mischaracterizing graduates’ salaries and other suspicious practices.

Fresh hope arrived this month for about 170,000 student borrowers who say their colleges defrauded them. Their requests for forgiveness of federal student loans, known as “borrower defense” claims, have gone unanswered by the U.S. Department of Education for months or years.

Now the agency, led by Secretary Betsy DeVos, has agreed to a firm 18-month deadline for processing the claims, through a settlement of the class-action lawsuit Sweet v. DeVos. With both sides framing it as a win, the compromise represents one step of progress while the larger question continues to play out: What’s the fairest way to satisfy the rights of misled borrowers while still ensuring that students, colleges, and the government all fulfill their respective responsibilities?

Recent actions by Congress, and multiple court rulings, reveal a bipartisan appetite for accelerating relief for defrauded borrowers.

Why We Wrote This How should the government help students defrauded by for-profit colleges? A lawsuit is pushing the Education Department to act more quickly on loan forgiveness – and raising questions about accountability and fairness.

Lead plaintiff Theresa Sweet says she followed a community college professor’s advice when she enrolled at what was then known as the Brooks Institute of Photography in California. The professor didn’t realize the school had been bought out by a for-profit company, she says. But two years into a program that required Ms. Sweet to take out $46,000 in federal loans and additional private loans, Brooks came under investigation for mischaracterizing graduates’ salaries and other suspicious practices.

By the time Ms. Sweet graduated in 2006, the only photography jobs the “career” office suggested were unpaid, she says in a phone interview. She has worked in sales and nursing assistant jobs ever since, she says.

After phoning hundreds of lawyers and getting nowhere, Ms. Sweet finally discovered the option of filing a borrower defense claim in 2016. She’s still waiting for an answer from the Education Department.

The settlement “feels like a huge victory,” she says. “I will get an answer. ... I won’t be just on the hook, waiting and waiting and waiting like I have been since I graduated.” But even if her federal loans are forgiven tomorrow, she says, “I’m still starting from scratch,” trying to build a positive credit history.

A reprieve for borrowers

The agreement will wipe out any interest these borrowers have accrued since filing their claims – once class members have the opportunity to comment and it is approved by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

It also includes the assurance that each month of delay beyond the new deadline would automatically lop 30% off an individual’s debt. And the agreement bars the garnishment of wages or other involuntary loan collections – with violations resulting in 80% of the borrower’s debt being canceled, according to the Project on Predatory Student Lending at Harvard University, which provided counsel for the plaintiffs.

“Getting rid of some of that interest and stopping the collections for this set of borrowers is really important; a lot of these people are in default,” says Beth Stein, a senior adviser at The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS).

Some of them are military veterans who used up their post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits and have told the Project on Predatory Student Lending that they feel betrayed not only by their schools, but now by the government as well.

Secretary DeVos has long held that her job is to protect American taxpayers by looking closely at borrower defense claims and demanding adequate proof that a student has been harmed. In public remarks she has attributed the delays to various lawsuits challenging the department’s approach.

The Education Department called the Sweet settlement “an important win for students and for taxpayers,” in a statement emailed to the Monitor by press secretary Angela Morabito. “The Department put a sound adjudication methodology in place. ... This proposed settlement is validation of that process and of the Department’s longstanding goal to resolve all of these claims as quickly as possible.”

In October, a federal judge in a separate case held Secretary DeVos in contempt because the Education Department illegally tried to collect debt from thousands of borrowers defrauded by the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges.

After more than a year in which the agency processed no borrower defense claims, the wheels started turning again in December. The Project on Predatory Student Lending estimates that 40,000 claims have been processed since then.

Secretary DeVos, aiming to reverse what she deemed overreach in the Obama administration, has written a new borrower defense rule, set to take effect July 1.

Among other restrictions, it would take away borrowers’ right to appeal, says Kyle Southern, who directs higher education policy work for the nonprofit advocacy group Young Invincibles. “This department has shown itself time and again to be more concerned with protecting the interests of predatory for-profit institutions than the rights of defrauded student borrowers,” he says.

The U.S. House and Senate have both voted on resolutions, with some bipartisan support, to overturn the new rule. In February, President Donald Trump’s advisers said they would recommend a veto, but he hasn't yet stated his intentions.

Embarrassment and accountability

Ms. Sweet says many borrowers in her situation are embarrassed to talk about falling for their college’s false promises. But she hopes the lawsuit will help the public “understand that what happened to us, it was fraud.” The government should be protecting students, she says, and if taxpayers are going to be upset, they should direct it at agencies that failed to hold schools accountable. “They shouldn’t be angry with students who were defrauded,” she says.

The debates over borrower defense claims are part of a “much bigger college accountability debate,” says Neal McCluskey, director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. While borrower advocates criticize Secretary DeVos for hiring people with ties to the for-profit education industry, he says, she has in turn suggested that those trying to police the industry are overzealous.

“We have seen evidence sometimes that charges against schools, lenders, services – that they appear worse when first reported than they are when you dig in,” he says.

Robert Eitel, an adviser to the Education Department and former executive at two for-profit education companies, generated controversy by reportedly being involved in rescinding the former borrower defense rule. An inspector general’s report recently concluded that Mr. Eitel did not appear to be in violation of federal ethics laws.

Depending on the extent of the economic slowdown, for-profit colleges might scale up quickly to encourage people out of work to go back to school, says Ms. Stein of TICAS. She offers some advice to prospective students: Shop around, and don’t let a school pressure you into making a quick decision to enroll.

“The Department of Education has really worked hard, under this administration and the previous administration, to get better information online for students through the College Scorecard,” she says. “See if you could go to a similar program at a community college or somewhere else nearby for a whole lot less money.”","A lawsuit is pushing the Education Department to act more quickly on loan forgiveness – and raising questions about accountability and fairness.

152,"Apr 23, 2020",MarketWatch,Opinion: Democrats’ promises of student-loan forgiveness and free tuition are not the answer,"Student debt and skyrocketing college tuition are terrible burdens for young adults, and Sen. Bernie Sanders promised to forgive their loans and make public colleges free. Former Vice President Joe Biden, in an effort to woo young voters, offers to expand federal income-based debt forgiveness programs and make state universities tuition-free for families with incomes under $125,000.

Higher education should not be so recast as an entitlement but rather the decadence of present arrangements should be targeted for pro-market reforms.

College should not be so expensive. The cost of hiring decent instructors for most disciplines—such as economics, physics or Western literature—is not high as compared to a good lawyer, architect or most other professionals. The problem is federal student loans have relieved universities of virtually all market discipline and accountability.

In 1972, the Federal Higher Education Act made government guaranteed student loans through banks and the Department of Education widely available. That put tens of thousands of dollars in the hands of teenagers to select colleges and programs of study.

Opportunities—previously reserved to the wealthy and professional classes, veterans through the GI Bill and working-class families that made Herculean sacrifices—were made available to virtually anyone with the wit and grit to complete four years of study.

In their early years, student loans offered a great investment. College graduates usually earned more and worked in more pleasant conditions than the factories, farms and supporting services where most folks labored. Aspirants could pay off loans much as businesses do for new equipment and enjoy better lives in the bargain.

Universities never perceived themselves as trade schools but rather as places that prepared a managerial elite exposed to the academy’s liberal values—the latter changing with the times but often challenging the prevailing social order.

Easy access to money borrowed by 18-year-olds permitted universities to enroll too many unqualified students, spawn huge bureaucracies, and offer faculty light teaching loads, while promoting majors in fields like sociology, gender studies and English literature that offer too few good employment opportunities upon graduation.

Subsidizing these choices drove college costs through the roof. Over the last two decades, tuition is up 37% more than health care and 77% more than the general rate of inflation.

Colleges and universities enroll about two-thirds of all high school graduates but about 40% of those drop out without earning a degree and are saddled with student loans a $15-an-hour job can’t service. And about 25% of college graduates earn no more than the average high school graduate.

Consequently, about half those who enroll as freshmen make a bad investment. Either they wash out or earn a degree that leaves them no better off financially and are saddled with loans no reasonable banker should have approved but for government guarantees.

Certainly, something should be done for all the young people who were lured into poor choices by university admission officers and faculty hungry for students. Heavy student loan debt is keeping young folks from buying homes, marrying and starting families and taking the plunge to start businesses.

As the federal government now holds or guarantees 90% of all college debt, it can wipe away those loans by issuing more bonds—something capital markets are more than willing to absorb—and then suing colleges that defrauded students to fetch back some of the losses.

However, market discipline must be brought to universities. To enroll students with federally guaranteed loans, universities should be required to freeze tuition until the inflation-adjusted cost of college is in line with health-care inflation over the last two decades. And universities should be required to borrow against their endowments, buildings and land to provide half the funds for student loans—and take losses if those are not repaid.

Professors would spend more time in classrooms, majors that offer too few employment opportunities would scale back, and bureaucracies such as those that enforce political correctness and promote academic tourism—winter break courses in Spain—would lose weight.

A lot more unqualified applicants would be turned away and instead could be encouraged to enroll in the Labor Department’s apprenticeship programs, where participants earn while they learn and usually garner starting incomes that beat those of college graduates.","Student debt and skyrocketing college tuition are terrible burdens for young adults, and Sen.

In recent weeks, health care workers have been heralded as heroes in the national response to the coronavirus pandemic. Wartime analogies flow freely: U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called the Covid-19 pandemic the most challenging global crisis since World War II. In a recent press briefing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made calls to “support our troops,” referring to health care workers as “the soldiers in this fight.” In many ways, the comparison is apt. Doctors, nurses, and support staff find themselves enlisted in a war against a virus that has infected thousands and killed hundreds of their colleagues globally. Public expressions of support for health professionals are meaningful. But they are also insufficient to drown out the deafening silence from Capitol Hill in response to mounting cries for relief measures — chief among them educational debt forgiveness.

Every Covid-19 patient admitted to the hospital will be cared for by a team of professionals who, theoretically, have over $1 million in combined student debt.

I am a physician and, unsurprisingly, the owner of a sizable student loan. You can’t become a doctor in America without paying for years of higher education, so I began my medical career with more than $200,000 in educational debt — the average for med school grads. In the U.S., the average salary for new doctors in training is about $57,000 per year. Four years into residency, and approximately $20,000 in loan payments later, I am still scraping away at the interest. I owe more than when I graduated. Now, as a psychiatry resident in the national epicenter of this crisis, I am tasked with responding to mental health emergencies, including for Covid-19-positive patients. When not in the hospital, I will provide outpatient coverage for co-workers pulled to work shifts in emergency rooms and intensive care units. Many junior psychiatry residents have already been “redeployed” to internal medicine teams overwhelmed by the tidal wave of Covid-19 patients. We are being extended far beyond our original job description. Even so, relative to my nursing, ER, and ICU colleagues, I have it easy.

Among indebted health care workers, young doctors are not alone. Almost 70 percent of all nurses — who staff the truest front line in this pandemic — graduate from training with $40,000 to $150,000 in debt. My sister, a family medicine nurse practitioner who oversees the clinic at her local homeless shelter, has dutifully paid interest on nursing school loans for 10 years without making a dent in the principal. Now, she reuses the same paper gown each day to examine patients with Covid-19 symptoms. The average debt of a graduating college student is roughly $30,000 — on par with the average annual salary for certified medication technicians, EMTs, and ambulance crew members. Just imagine: Every Covid-19 patient admitted to the hospital will be cared for by a team of professionals who, theoretically, have over $1 million in combined student debt. So, sure, you can call us heroes. But we’d prefer debt relief.

Critics will say an economic crisis is no time to talk about student debt reform. Some view such reform as placing an undue burden on American taxpayers. Others will remind us that we signed up for these jobs and, hey, at least we have jobs. But, in the age of Covid-19, the reality facing health care workers is more akin to military deployment than a day at work. We now speak of front lines, redeployments, isolation zones, tours of duty. For many, these are no longer the jobs we signed up for, but they do demand skills we indebted ourselves to acquire. Much has been made of the shortage of personal protective equipment plaguing our nation during this crisis. This shortage has already — and will continue to — cost health care workers their health and, for many, their lives. From janitorial staff to respiratory therapists to attending doctors, we are all filling gaps in a system not designed for global pandemic. And when the dust settles, many will need to rebuild their health while contending with the very real trauma of working amid an onslaught of sick, dying, and mourning patients, as well as their families. Covid-19 health care veterans deserve better than the six-month stay on loan payments for all borrowers as a part of the recently passed stimulus. Certainly, we deserve better than the bedraggled Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, for which many of us do not qualify and which — having rejected 99 percent of all applicants in 2018 — was called “fundamentally broken” by the very government officials hired to manage it. If health care workers did our jobs as poorly as the Department of Education manages student loans, patients would die at an alarming rate. And yet, with awe-inspiring reliability, health care workers are rising to the occasion, demonstrating commitment to the ethics of the field. I am proud to be part of this community, proud to have skills that ease patient suffering. What, then, is a reasonable way for our government to repay this burden?","Photo: Marcus Yam/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesIn recent weeks, health care workers have been heralded as heroes in the national response to the coronavirus pandemic.

154,"Apr 21, 2020",Inside Higher Ed,College groups tell Congress to put off debt cancellation,"Associations representing the nation’s colleges and universities told congressional leaders on Monday they should put off considering canceling student debt until later.

Instead, the American Council on Education, and other associations representing four-year institutions as well as community colleges, in a letter said Congress should focus right now on providing short-term help for borrowers as it considers at least one additional stimulus package. The groups proposed, for example, extending the moratorium on making loan repayments that Congress approved in its last stimulus package, until the nation recovers from the recession being caused by the pandemic.

But on broader proposals such as canceling student debt, the associations wrote, “we believe that should more appropriately occur as part of reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.”

However, many who signed the letter are skeptical that Congress will get to the update of the nation’s main higher education law this year.

Kyle Southern, policy and advocacy director for higher education and workforce for the Young Invincibles, an advocacy group focused on millenials, responded, “Young people can't wait for Congress to act on HEA to deal with the crisis that they were facing even before COVID-19.”

The stance by college leaders, as well as other higher education groups like the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, comes after calls by congressional Democrats to cancel student debt in stimulus packages.

Democrats in both the House and Senate proposed during the negotiations over the last package, the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, that the federal government make monthly loan repayments on behalf of borrowers and guarantee that at least $10,000 be paid toward balances of each borrower.

Progressive Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also have called for student debt cancellation as part of any stimulus package.

Student loan debt cancellation MUST be a part of the next emergency coronavirus package to deliver relief immediately to millions of families and remove a giant weight that’s dragging down our economy. Senate and House progressives are in this fight all the way. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 17, 2020

And just last week, Young Invincibles and 65 other progressive groups wrote congressional leaders, calling for some form of debt cancellation -- like the Democrats’ proposals in the CARES Act -- to be included as part of the stimulus.

Not including cancellation in a stimulus package “sets up millions of federal student loan borrowers to face the daunting prospect of trying to find the means to pay their student loans in the middle of economic devastation,” the groups said.

The new letter by the higher ed groups, including the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, the Association of American Universities, and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, comes at a time when higher education institutions are vying for more federal dollars in one of the upcoming packages Congress is expected to consider.

Higher ed organizations also wrote congressional leaders two weeks ago to seek an additional $46.6 billion in aid for colleges, saying the $14 billion Congress put in the CARES Act for higher education “does not come close to filling the gap.” Instead, the associations wrote that they expect to lose $23 billion from a 15 percent projected decline in enrollment this fall.

Focus on Immediate Relief

In an interview, however, Terry Hartle, the American Council on Education’s senior vice president for government relations and public affairs (and an occasional opinion contributor to Inside Higher Ed), denied that institutions were worried debt cancellation would siphon away money the colleges are desperate to get.

Instead, Hartle said the stance reflected what he said congressional staff working on stimulus packages have been telling advocates -- to focus on immediate relief to get people through the public health and economic crisis.

In the letter, the associations acknowledged that student loan borrowers need help. “The pandemic will greatly hamper the ability of many of these individuals to repay their loans, and this in turn will strain the economy unless Congress moves quickly to provide needed, targeted relief to student loan borrowers,” they wrote.

But, in part, the call to take up debt cancellation later appeared to reflect the division even among progressives about the idea.

“Any large-scale debt relief initiative would prove very expensive, and may benefit high-income and other borrowers who do not require assistance in meeting their obligations,” the letter said. If Congress does take up debt cancellation, the associations wrote, “any debt relief program should be targeted to borrowers who are financially distressed and face the greatest difficulty repaying their loans.”

Justin Draeger, president and CEO of NASFAA, worried bringing up the debt cancellation idea would lead to political gridlock and hold up help for borrowers now.

“How to expand and equitably distribute loan forgiveness, not to mention implementing something so complicated, is a much larger conversation that threatens to derail tangible steps Congress could and should take now,” he said.

And indeed, a Republican aide on the Senate education committee told Inside Higher Ed last week that at least among Republicans, “I don’t think there’s any appetite for debt forgiveness or cancellation because it has nothing to do with COVID.”

A higher priority, representatives of the associations said, is for Congress to take immediate steps, like excusing borrowers from having to make loan payments until the economy recovers -- at least through June 30, 2021, or until the unemployment rate falls below 8 percent for three consecutive months. That would extend the 60-day moratorium included in the CARES Act.

The associations also proposed extending for a year the six- to nine-month grace period for making federal loan payments after graduation. “Students who complete their programs in the near future will be graduating into the worst employment market since the federal student loan programs were created,” the letter said. “Extending the post-graduation grace period for one year for students leaving school will help them gain their post-graduation financial footing.”

In addition, the letter recommended borrowers taking out federal student loans only be charged a 1.5 percent interest rate, instead of the current rates of between 4.53 percent for Stafford loans and 7.08 percent for Grad PLUS and Parent PLUS loans.

The associations also proposed making it easier for borrowers to escape student debt when filing for bankruptcy.

“With the increased economic insecurity America faces, more citizens will declare bankruptcy,” the letter said. ""When they do, all debts, including student loans, should be eliminated.

Southern responded, “They also should not have to depend on bankruptcy as an escape valve from the debt levels caused by skyrocketing higher education costs and declining public financial support.

On Tuesday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state has secured relief options for student loan borrowers who weren’t previously covered by the federal CARES Act, which provides relief to those with federal loans, but not to those with private loans or federal loans not owned by the federal government.

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

The state has secured relief options with 20 private loan servicers, which could provide relief to more than 138,000 residents, according to Pritzker’s office.

“At this unprecedented time of financial hardship, it was essential to find a way to provide relief to all student loan borrowers who are struggling financially due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Deborah Hagan, secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, in a statement.

Illinois residents who have commercially owned Federal Family Education Program Loans or privately held student loans who are struggling to make payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be eligible under the new initiative.

Borrowers in need of assistance should contact their student loan servicer to identify the options that are appropriate to their circumstances. According to the governor’s office, relief options include:

— Providing a minimum of 90 days of forbearance

— Waiving late payment fees

— Ensuring that no borrower is subject to negative credit reporting

— Ceasing debt collection lawsuits for 90 days

— Working with borrower to enroll them in other borrower assistance programs, such as income based repayment.

If regulated student loan servicers are limited in their ability to take such actions due to investor restrictions or contractual obligations, servicers should proactively work with loan holders whenever possible to relax those restrictions or obligations, according to the governor’s office.

If a borrower is experiencing trouble with their student loan servicer, they should file a complaint with the IDFPR Division of Banking (217-785-2900), contact the Attorney General’s Student Loan Helpline (800-455-2456), file a complaint with the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, or file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Borrowers can visit the Department of Education’s National Student Loan Data System to determine the types of federal loans they have and who their servicers are, or call the Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid Information Center at 800-433-3243 or 800-730-8913 (TDD). Borrowers with private student loans can check the contact information on their monthly billing statements.

The Illinois Department of Public Health reported Tuesday an additional 1,551 cases of COVID-19 and 119 deaths, bringing the totals to 33,059 and 1,468, respectively. Across the state, 96 of Illinois’ 102 counties have been impacted, according to IDPH.

During his daily press briefing Tuesday, Pritzker was asked about plans for his stay-at-home order, which is set to expire April 30. The governor said he’s “working on making changes” to the order, and that residents should not expect mass openings of businesses on May 1.

While there will be changes to the stay-at-home order, Pritzker says it is working. “To remove it, as I see some other governors may want to do, to remove it entirely is to simply open everything back up to infection,” he said.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday she expects Pritzker to extend the order beyond April 30, which is “no longer a viable date” for it to be lifted. “I would expect an extension of the stay at home order … through sometime in May,” Lightfoot said.

The order could also be extended into June, Lightfoot said. “We are not even close to being out of the woods,” she said.

Pritzker acknowledged that the state is “weeks away” from seeing its peak in the number of cases. “In order for us to truly open things up we need (contact) tracing, we need testing and we need a treatment available, and we need widespread availability of PPE,” Pritzker said. “And we don’t have those things available today.”

An additional 200,000 New Jersey residents with student loan debt could see relief thanks to measures announced Tuesday in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the initiative, some individuals with privately held student loans who are struggling to make payments will be eligible for new loan flexibility.

Service providers have agreed to postpone payments for at least 90 days, waive late fees, suspend negative credit reporting and help people enroll in borrower assistance programs, the state said. They've also agreed to cease debt collection lawsuits for 90 days,

Gov. Phil Murphy and Banking and Insurance Commissioner Marlene Caride said the initiative would benefit people who hold private loans or commercially owned Federal Family Education Program Loans — groups not covered by previous loan relief programs announced by New Jersey and the federal government.

“Far too many New Jerseyans struggle with crushing student loan debt in good times, and our current crisis has only exacerbated the problem,” Murphy said in a statement Tuesday. “This initiative will provide much needed relief to New Jerseyans who are struggling with student loans and other financial obligations during this crisis.”

Borrowers should immediately contact loan service providers about their options, the state said.

The initiative is designed to help residents manage debt in the throes of a coronavirus pandemic that has created severe economic hardship for families and led to record unemployment claims.

The federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act had previously provided relief to students with federal loans but did not apply to those with private ones. This effort ensures they also get the help they need to weather the economic fallout, officials said.

“Through this effort, New Jersey residents will have payment options available as they are working to balance the financial needs of their families and obligations that include student loans, during this unprecedented time,” Caride said.

Some loan servicers may be “limited in their ability to take these actions due to investor restrictions or contractual obligations,” the Department of Banking said. Those companies should work with loan holders on their own to relax those restrictions or obligations when possible, the state urged.

157,"Apr 20, 2020",Fox Business,Coronavirus student loan interest waivers being offered — how to take advantage,"In an effort to bring aid to those struggling during the coronavirus crisis, President Trump has taken significant measures to ease the burden of student loan payments on borrowers. On March 13, he announced the interest on student loans would be waived “until further notice” and on March 20 he took things a step further by suspending student loan payments until September 30, 2020.

If you have questions about what this could mean for your student loans, keep reading. Below are some answers to the biggest questions surrounding these new measures.

How to take advantage of the student loan interest waiver

There are several ways that you can take advantage of waiving interest on student loans. For one, as explained above, you can continue to make payments on your loans interest-free. However, you have other options available to you, as well. They are as follows:

Refinancing

For another, now is a good time to consider refinancing. Student loan interest rates are incredibly low right now, thanks to multiple rate cuts. If you can refinance, it may make sense to lock in at an affordable rate and lower your monthly payment.

Public student loan forgiveness

In addition, those trying for public student loan forgiveness will be pleased to know that, even if they pause their student loan payments for the allowed six-month period, those payments will still be counted towards the required 120 monthly federal student loan payments. Since the legislation is so new, your lender may not have updated information on this yet, but it’s a smart idea to keep checking back for updates.WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PERSON YOU COSIGNED FOR DOESN'T PAY?

Income-driven repayment plans

As with public student loan forgiveness, even if you pause your payments during coronavirus, they will count towards your 20 or 25 years or payments, which are required under your income-driven repayment plan.

Which student loans qualify for suspension and waivers?

The suspension and waivers only apply to student loans that are owned by the federal government. This means that if you have private student loans, as well as some Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) and Perkins Loans, they may not qualify.

REFINANCE STUDENT LOANS NOW AND YOU'LL LIKELY SAVE MONEY — HERE'S WHY

If you’re not sure if your federal loans are eligible, your best bet is to talk to your loan servicer to talk about your options. If you’re currently having trouble making your payments, it may make sense to try to consolidate your non-qualifying loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan, which does fall under federal jurisdiction.

Those with private student loans should also know that the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act does allow your employer to help pay up to $5,250 of your student loans this year. If you’re struggling to make your payments, it may be worth contacting your loan servicer to discuss that option.

How this affects your student loans

If you are able to keep making payments on your student loans during this time, it makes financial sense to do so. While these measures will not change the amount that you’re expected to pay monthly toward your student loans, they will affect how your payment is allocated, which can save you money in the long run.

5 STUDENT LOAN MISTAKES THAT CAN COST YOU THOUSANDS

Essentially, every time you make a payment toward your loans, a portion of that payment goes to paying the interest that has accrued on the loan and the remainder goes to paying down the principal loan amount, or the amount that you’ve borrowed.

Since no new interest is accruing on your loans during this period, you have a chance to get ahead. If you keep making payments on your loans, a portion of your payment will go toward paying down any previously-accrued interest and then the remainder will go toward your principal loan amount.

Over time, you’ll be able to pay down more of your principal balance than you would have if interest had kept accruing, which means you’ll be able to pay off your student loans faster.","In an effort to bring aid to those struggling during the coronavirus crisis, President Trump has taken significant measures to ease the burden of student loan payments on borrowers.

Students are responsible for the interest that accrues on their unsubsidized student loans during all periods.

Like subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans are eligible for many federal benefits like Income-Driven Repayment (IDR), federal forbearance and deferment, and forgiveness programs like PSLF and Teacher Loan Forgiveness.

Read more personal finance coverage.

Need to take out student loans to help cover the cost of college? If so, federal student loans are a good place to start. The Department of Education offers two main types of federal student loans to eligible schools: Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized loans.

Both types of student loans are eligible for key federal benefits like Income-Driven Repayment and federal forbearance and deferment. And both qualify for federal forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and Teacher Loan Forgiveness.

But while they bear many similarities, there are a few key differences between subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Let's take a closer look at unsubsidized loans to see what sets them apart.

What is an unsubsidized loan?

An unsubsidized loan is a federal student loan that's available to all students who are enrolled at least half-time in an eligible school. The main difference between unsubsidized and subsidized loans is that unsubsidized loans are accessible to a large number of students.

Unlike subsidized loans, students do not need to demonstrate financial need to qualify for an unsubsidized loan. And Direct Unsubsidized loans are the only type of Direct Stafford loan that can be used to help cover the cost of a graduate or professional program.

But if accessibility is the biggest benefit of unsubsidized loans, their biggest disadvantage is that students are responsible to pay the interest that accrues on them during all periods. With subsidized loans, on the other hand, the government will cover your interest charges while you're still in school and during your six-month grace period.

What are the interest rates and fees for an unsubsidized loan?

For undergraduate students, the interest rate on unsubsidized loans is 4.53% (the same as subsidized loans). But for graduate students, the interest rate increases to 6.08%.

All students must pay a 1.059% loan fee each time they take out a new unsubsidized student loan. The loan fee is deducted from your loan disbursement, which means that your total amount borrowed will be higher than the actual money you received during school.

How much can you borrow in unsubsidized loans?

Another benefit of unsubsidized student loans is that they have much higher annual and aggregate loan limits than their subsidized loan counterparts.

For example, first-year independent students can borrow no more than $3,500 in subsidized loans, but they can borrow up to $9,500 in unsubsidized loans. Here's a quick breakdown of the yearly and aggregate loan limits for unsubsidized student loans:

Clint Proctor

Your school will ultimately determine how much you can borrow in unsubsidized student loans by comparing their cost of attendance to any additional financial aid that may be available to you.

When does repayment begin on unsubsidized loans?

Like subsidized loans, you're not required to make payments on your unsubsidized student loans while you're still enrolled at least half-time in school. And you'll also have a six-month grace period after you leave school before you must begin repayment.

However, it's important to understand that interest on unsubsidized loans will continue to accrue even during periods of non-payment. And if you don't pay those interest charges, they will be added to your principal once repayment begins (this is called capitalization).

To avoid this, you could elect to pay only the interest on your unsubsidized loans while you're in school. Talk to your loan servicer about how to set up interest-only payments while you're in school if this is something that you're interested in.

How do you apply for an unsubsidized loan?

There is no specific application for Direct Unsubsidized loans. Instead, the school that you're planning to attend will typically include them in your financial aid package if you have a funding gap.

To qualify for Direct Unsubsidized loans in your financial aid package, you'll need to fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Your school will use your FAFSA information to decide how much student aid you're entitled to receive.","An unsubsidized loan is a federal student loan that's available to all undergraduate or graduate students regardless of financial need.

160,"Apr 16, 2020",The Boston Globe,The case for death benefits and loan forgiveness for coronavirus front-line health care workers,"Front-line COVID-19 health care workers are at increased risk of severe illness. They are pursuing their calling and jobs selflessly, yet are appropriately concerned not just about themselves but about not being there for their families. Many don’t have adequate insurance, and don’t solely have federal student loans: While federal loans are discharged after death, private student loans are not. Which is why Congress should pass legislation granting death benefits and educational debt relief for front-line health care workers.

Much has been written about the sacrifice that health care providers are making to care for patients suffering from COVID-19. Doctors updating their wills and sleeping away from their families to reduce risk of exposure. Nurses going to the bedside of patients, concerned about staffing levels, lack of adequate protective equipment, and exposure to the disease. Emergency medical works overwhelmed with cases in the field. Housekeeping staff keeping virus-laden rooms clean. Yet the question medical residents are asking cuts to the core of the heroism and tragedy the medical community is facing: Will there be death payments to their family and relief of their student debt if they die while fighting COVID-19?

This would not be done during normal periods of practice but only under these historic circumstances. There are precedents in other domains to which this pandemic response has been compared. The military has increased death gratuity payments for combat, and forms of debt relief. Police, firefighters, and other first responders have death and survivor benefits for those killed in the line of duty. A Public Safety Officer’s Benefits Program, administered by the Department of Justice, provides monetary compensation and educational benefits to survivors. A similar program should be considered for health workers who die fighting COVID-19. It could be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.

After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the World Trade Center Volunteer Fund was established to provide benefits to volunteers who incurred health-related illness from their work in the rescue, search, and recovery. In addition, the Victim Compensation Fund had provisions for rescuers and first responders. The fund was reactivated by the federal government in 2011, and the “Never Forget the Heroes” Permanent Authorization Act was signed into law last year to extend and ensure continued access for claimants. Mechanisms for professional fund oversight and identification for fraudulent claims are rigorous. In the current medical crisis, exposure information and claims could be verified through hospitals and health systems.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 9,200 health care workers have been infected with COVID-19. Of this number, thought to be a substantial underestimate, 60 percent reported having contact with a COVID-19 patient in the health care setting within the prior two weeks. Among these, there were at least 184 intensive care admissions and 27 deaths. The Minnesota state health department reports up to 28 percent of COVID-19 cases are health care workers. In Ohio, early this week, 18 percent of health care workers were infected. In Massachusetts, more than 6,500 front-line health care workers have jobs that put them at increased risk of exposure, and over 1,600 hospital workers have tested positive for COVID-19. In Italy, over 130 doctors, nurses and nurses aides are dead so far. These numbers reflect limited testing and are rising by the day. While not all cases are necessarily acquired on the job, health care workers are at increased risk, with more severe cases, due to close, prolonged proximity to greater concentrations of the virus.

There is also a compelling case for forgiving remaining medical educational debt for those who die fighting this scourge, especially for those who had barely begun to practice. Legislation should be introduced to guarantee this. The average medical student debt exceeds $200,000; the average nursing school debt is approximately $20,000.

The total amount of funding would be justified, consonant with analogous funding for the fallen heroes of other national disasters, and would not be prohibitive, even with the present economic losses, alongside the government-allocated COVID-19 stimulus/support funds. (It should be noted that the other funds to be allocated for hospitals and medical systems are to mitigate tremendous operating losses for the hospitals and to allow them to survive and continue to battle the pandemic.)

It is the least we can do to honor, compensate, and remember fallen health care workers, and their families. It would bring at least some peace of mind to those who are bravely coming into the hospital for their shifts, being called on to possibly make the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf as this historic plague spreads across our nation.

If you’re hoping for a quick recovery from the Covid-19-driven economic collapse, we’ve got good news and bad news. The good news is that we’ve studied the Great Recession and singled out a crucial factor in how fast the economy can recover: debt relief. The bad news is that, right now, Washington isn’t taking serious action to give people a break on their mortgage and rent payments, student debt, and auto loans.

This crisis did not start in the household sector, but the problems faced by households are similar to 2008. The record 16.8 million new jobless claims already filed have mortgage lenders preparing for the biggest wave of delinquencies in history. By our estimates, more than 30% of all borrowers could default on their mortgage, about 1.5 times the level of defaults during the 2008 crisis. As we learned in that recession, the pain of defaults does not stop with the borrower: The damage creates ripple effects that slow down the economy. Ruined credit scores make it harder for borrowers to get future loans, foreclosed homes fall in value and bring down neighborhood property values, and cities suffer when borrowers have less to spend at local restaurants and businesses.

Washington has to move quickly—right now—because we know from the Great Recession that how we handle debt relief today will critically determine the speed of the recovery. Swift action can prevent the imminent surge of mortgage defaults from spiraling into a prolonged recession.

We analyzed a decade of data and millions of U.S. households following the Great Recession, finding that regions that did not receive household debt relief took about four more years to recover in terms of consumer spending, house prices, and employment than the ones that did. In general, both household debt overhang and the foreclosures that follow mortgage defaults significantly hamper economic activity and slow down economic recovery.

Washington has at least acknowledgedthis need: A major piece of the $2 trillion Cares Act is a mandate that all borrowers with government-backed mortgages—about two-thirds of all mortgages—be allowed to delay at least 90 days of monthly payments and possibly up to a year’s worth. This is an important first step that buys us some time. But it will not be enough and should not be considered a long-term remedy. These deferred payments will need to be made at a later time. Households already distressed, because they lost jobs or income, will have a hard time coming up with the money, when the time comes.

An even more important lesson from the Great Recession is that the method for distributing debt relief is critical. The Cares Act calls for relying on private sector loan servicers—like Wells Fargo and Bank of America—for debt relief. But we cannot and should not rely solely on the private sector, because we have some evidence of how they respond. After the Great Recession, the Obama administration created programs in 2009 designed to encourage banks and lenders to refinance and work out mortgages. But many decided against it anyway because it didn’t align with their incentives: Some mortgage servicrs felt they did not have enough incentives to restructure loans, many banks and lenders felt borrowers didn’t have enough equity, they didn’t see a competitive need to offer refinancing, or they didn’t want to encourage moral hazard. Several simply didn’t have the organizational ability to conduct restructuring on a large scale. The results were discouraging: even though these programs were designed to help 12 million borrowers, barely 5 million were actually able to use them. In fact, loan servicers’ refusal to renegotiate with many borrowers, particularly in the first year of the Great Recession, by itself accounted for upward of two million foreclosures.

At a fundamental level, a bank or investor’s balance sheet doesn’t reflect the positive impact of an unemployed airline or hotel worker keeping their home and being able to spend more freely. Nor will it reflect the adverse effects to the local economy of foreclosing a home. Banks and lenders have a fiduciary duty to focus on returns for their investors. Left to implement programs on their own, they’re not likely to achieve the level of debt relief that the U.S. needs right now. And under the Cares Act, banks and loan servicers are now required to make up any shortfall in payments in the interim. Just like in the aftermath of the Great Recession, banks and lenders will have the wrong incentives if we want them to help borrowers with their mortgage payment.

Vulnerable households need permanent and quick debt relief. Washington can help directly. The easiest and cheapest approach would be to leave debt balances intact and instead forgive or take over the interest payments on debt, including mortgages, credit cards, and student loan debt. Since federal and state governments mandated the stay-at-home orders creating this downturn, it is only reasonable that taxpayers should pick up the tab. A good policy would start by forgiving six months of interest—and working directly with borrowers rather than relying on lenders for implementation. A reevaluation of the length can be done later when we have a clearer picture of the severity of the crisis.

Renters, by definition, do not make interest payments and unfortunately wouldn’t benefit. Washington should consider a special housing voucher program that offers relief to renters and avoids evictions.

To make sure taxpayers don’t overcommit, the federal government could impose eligibility requirements, targeting relief to those households that have suffered a documented loss of income or financial hardship. By our estimates, a targeted policy could cost up to $100 billion.

Congress should start taking these measures into account when it returns to Washington to start work on the next phase of the economic rescue.If we do not act aggressively and immediately, we risk making the same mistakes that resulted in a prolonged and slow recovery during the last crisis.

162,"Apr 14, 2020",Money,Companies Are Now Getting a Tax Break to Help Employees Pay Down Student Loans During Coronavirus,"Companies have a new incentive to help their employees pay down their student debt.

The incentive—a new tax break—is thanks to a less-highlighted provision in the CARES Act, which also temporarily pauses payments and interest on most federal student loans as part of the government’s efforts to ease the financial chaos caused by the coronavirus.

Employers can now pay up to $5,250 toward an employee’s student loans tax-free through the end of the year. Traditionally, these payments are treated as wages, but until December 31, 2020, these payments are excluded from income and payroll taxes – benefitting both the employer and those receiving the repayment assistance.

Scott Thompson, who runs a company that manages these programs, says he has no doubt this change will accelerate adoption of loan repayment assistance programs by employers, despite the economic impacts of COVID-19.

“While we certainly are dealing with a growing number of economic uncertainties as a result of the virus, we are expecting the percentage [of participating companies] to increase dramatically over the course of the second half of this year and next,” Thompson, CEO of Tuition.io, says.

Thompson points out that industries that are on the frontlines of dealing with the crisis, such as healthcare, are looking to fortify benefits for employees by adding student loan repayment. He is seeing a growing number of clients who are working to launch new student loan benefits later this quarter and early in the second half of the year.

Although the tax exemption is through the end of this year, Thompson says he is confident it will get adopted as a permanent change to the IRS tax code.

How Employer Student Loan Assistance Works

Approximately 8% of employers currently offer student loan payment benefit, which has doubled from 4% in 2018, according to Society for Human Resource Management.

With outstanding U.S. student debt growing daily and totaling roughly $1.7 trillion, companies offer loan repayment assistance to attract and retain college-educated employers.

“It is clear that we have reached a tipping point and student loans are having secondary impacts on many professionals,” says a spokesperson for accounting firm PwC.

PwC has paid more than $37 million toward student loan debt as a result of their program, one of the first of its kind. The benefit pays $1,200 a year for up to six years to help associates and senior associates pay down their student loans.

Estée Lauder has nearly 1,000 full-time employees registered for its student loan assistance program. The company contributes $100 towards eligible employees’ student loans every month, with a $10,000 lifetime maximum contribution, according to a spokesperson for the company.

Chegg, Fidelity Investments, Penguin Random House and Hulu are some of other companies that offer this benefit.

What You Should Know If Your Employer Repays Your Student Loans

Any amount paid by the employer toward interest on the student loans is not eligible for a deduction on your federal taxes. (Borrowers can subtract up to $2,500 in interest paid on student loans from their taxable income.)

“Employers can work around this restriction by targeting their payments to apply just to principal,” says Mark Kantrowitz, Publisher at Savingforcollege.com. “The borrower's payments will then cover the interest and still qualify for the student loan interest deduction.”

Prior to the CARES Act, any money received toward student loans counted as income for the employee. That means you’d normally pay taxes on the amount, and if you had federal student loans in an income-based repayment plan, your monthly payment could increase due to the resulting higher income. Yet for the rest of 2020 (unless the provision is extended) repayment assistance doesn’t count as taxable income, and so neither of those will happen.

How Much (and Who) Do Student Loan Employee Benefit Programs Help?

Even though the temporary tax-law change helps some borrowers, it has critics who say the policy is regressive.

Adam Looney, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, points out that this benefit only helps borrowers who are still employed and who work at companies that offer generous benefits.

He estimates that borrowers in the bottom 40% of the income distribution, who earn less than roughly $42,000 get about 5% of the tax benefit. Those with student loans who are in the top 20% of the income distribution will get nearly half the total benefits.

""Rather than providing relief to distressed borrowers,"" he writes, ""the provision instead showers tax cuts on high-income workers with good jobs.""

163,"Apr 14, 2020",TechCrunch,"College isn’t free yet, but Savi raises a $6M Series A to assist student loan borrowers find loan forgiveness – TechCrunch","The student loan crisis has crescendoed to even worse heights. As universities shut down across the country due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and employment opportunities dim with the rapidly decelerating economy, today’s students and post-grads need better tools than ever to navigate their finances.

Unfortunately, student loans in the United States are extraordinarily complicated, with literally hundreds of variations on loan terms, repayment methods and public interest forgiveness options. For borrowers, what are the best ways to minimize their total burden while staying within the rules?

Washington, DC-based Savi wants to make student loan borrowers “savvy” to the best options available to them, and now it has even more capital to take on this pressing challenge. The company announced today that it has raised a $6 million Series A led by Nyca Partners, one of the most influential investing firms in the fintech space.

Finance startups often have misaligned incentives between users and their own revenue models — a financial health app may make quiet referral revenue by peddling new credit cards and loans, exactly what a user doesn’t need.

What makes Savi interesting is that the company was designed from the beginning to make sure that it always placed the interests of its users first. It’s organized as a public benefit corporation and founded by two idealistic founders who came together over improving the outcomes of the nation’s youth.

After graduating from Georgetown Law, Aaron Smith founded and spent four years running Young Invincibles, a youth-focused think tank and advocacy organization that was originally created to bring attention to youth issues during the healthcare reform discussions in the early years of the Obama administration. Meanwhile, Savi’s other co-founder, Tobin Van Ostern, worked on youth voter engagement for Obama’s first presidential campaign as the head of Students for Barack Obama before heading to the liberal Center for American Progress.

Together, they decided to found Savi to bring their progressive mission orientation to helping young people around student debt. The student loan world is “fairly complicated, and while obviously I think there needs to be continued improvement on the policy side, we needed solutions for student loan borrowers right now,” Smith explained. “And so that was sort of the impetus behind Savi — to use technology to create those kind of solutions.”

Savi ingests student loan data from users and then begins crunching the numbers to calculate the best options for repayment or forgiveness while taking into account the goals of its users.

While student lending is a trillion-dollar-plus market, Savi — owing to its progressive roots — has been particularly focused on offering its platform to users like social workers, teachers and service workers. One of their largest partners is NEA, the largest teachers union in the United States with around 3 million members, and Savi is offered as a benefit to its members.

Organizations offer Savi’s student loan assessment tool to their employees and members to help them understand their financial picture. That tool is free for users, but from there, Savi charges a subscription to actively manage a user’s student loans, such as automating the process for filling out paperwork. Users can calculate their savings using Savi before committing to paying a subscription, ensuring that no user pays if Savi can’t help them save money. The company says that the average borrower sees $140 in savings per month and pays a $5-a-month subscription fee.

Given the typical employment of its users, Savi has a particular specialty on loan forgiveness, an option that many student loans offer for people in public-interest careers. Such options often have byzantine rules for eligibility though, and so Savi works to ensure that borrowers seeking forgiveness stay within the rules of their loan programs. Currently, the company handles more than 150 forgiveness and repayment options.

Similar to its assessment tools for organizations, Savi launched a new tool around COVID-19 to help people in health professions or who have been laid off as a result of the pandemic to figure out their student loan situations and find new programs for help. “We actually happen to have a pretty disproportionately high number of users that actually work on the COVID crisis,” Van Ostern explained.

Startups around managing student loans have been a popular area of investment for VCs. Yesterday, my colleague Alex Wilhelm noted that student loan platform Frank received a $5 million interim strategic round of funding, with edtech giant Chegg taking a board seat. I also covered Summer’s $10 million raise late last year, which, like Savi, is a public benefit corporation focused on minimizing the burden of student loan payments.

In addition to Nyca, Savi received funding from AlleyCorp, Temerity Capital and 9Yards Capital, along with Michelle Kang, Catherine Reynolds and Sheila Lirio Marcelo.","The student loan crisis has crescendoed to even worse heights.

With the passing of the COVID-19 pandemic economic rescue package — known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security or “CARES” Act — many U.S. citizens and residents can expect to receive stimulus checks for up to $1,200 in the coming weeks. Unfortunately, however, the majority of college students won’t receive these funds.

Unless you’re over the age of 24 and have filed taxes as an independent in 2018 or 2019 (or can still do so), you’ve likely been left out of this round of coronavirus crisis-related relief. But on the other hand, the government recently announced a $6 billion distribution of emergency aid to colleges. Depending on your school’s policy, you could get some money to help cover expenses.

Here’s what you need to know about the economic relief checks and what you can do to get financial aid as a college student:

Who is (and isn’t) eligible for a CARES Act check?

To receive a CARES Act economic relief check, you must meet certain criteria for age and income. Specifically…

Single filers who earned $75,000 or less in the previous tax year (see below) will get $1,200

who earned $75,000 or less in the previous tax year (see below) will get $1,200 Married joint filers who made $150,000 or less will get $2,400

who made $150,000 or less will get $2,400 Filers who reported a higher income than the above limits will see their checks reduced by $5 for every $100 earned above the thresholds.

than the above limits will see their checks reduced by $5 for every $100 earned above the thresholds. However, single filers who made more than $99,000 and joint filers who took in more than $198,000 won’t be eligible for any funds .

. The government will add an extra $500 for each dependent under the age of 17

The IRS will look at your tax information from the 2019 year to determine your eligibility — or if you haven’t filed yet, your 2018 return will be used instead.

Many college students are over 18 and therefore too old to count as children, but they also don’t yet file taxes as an independent — you can potentially stay on your parent’s or guardian’s tax return until age 24. As a result, they won’t receive an economic relief check, nor will their family get extra funds on their behalf.

You might get aid from your college

While college students were left out of the first round of coronavirus crisis-related relief, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced plans on April 9 to release additional funds which schools can use to help their students.

Colleges are slated to receive a total of $6.28 billion in funding and will be required to use that money to provide cash grants to students. According to the Department of Education, these grants should be earmarked for expenses related to course materials, technology, food, housing, health care and child care.

How this aid is distributed could vary from school to school, but Temple University’s Hope Center proposed a set of best practices, including the removal of as much red tape as possible for students who need this aid.

As it stands now, students may need to apply for emergency grants from their college rather than expect to receive them automatically. Since this remains a developing situation, it’s worth checking directly with your school’s financial aid office to learn about your options.

Alternative ways to get relief as a college student

Depending on your age, financial needs and other factors, you might already qualify for financial relief. Here are some possibilities, depending on your situation…

Independent students over age 24 could qualify

While most college students aren’t eligible for a CARES Act rebate check, independent students over the age of 24 may qualify. As mentioned, the IRS bases your eligibility on your previous tax return.

If you didn’t make more than $12,200 last year or the year before, then you weren’t required to file income taxes. But it’s not too late — you could still file taxes using an online service such as the IRS’ Free File Program or other free third-party software.

Make sure to provide the IRS with your direct deposit information (non-filers can do so here). As long as the IRS has your bank account details, it can deposit the funds into your account within a few weeks. If it doesn’t have your details, however, you might be waiting around for months before you see any payout.

Work-study students could still get paid

As part of the CARES Act, colleges may continue paying students whose work-study jobs were interrupted due to the coronavirus outbreak. If you had a work-study job before campus closed, you might still get the wages you would have made — check with your school for details.

You could get a Federal Supplemental Educational and Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)

While colleges typically award FSEOGs to students with exceptional financial need, the CARES Act has widened the eligibility criteria for these grants. Under this legislation, colleges can provide FSEOG funds to undergraduate or graduate students who experience unexpected expenses or have unmet financial need.

If your financial circumstances have changed due to the coronavirus pandemic, contact your school’s financial aid office about your eligibility for an FSEOG.

Some colleges are issuing refunds

With the closure of campuses across the country, colleges are scrambling to determine whether to issue refunds to students. Some are prorating room and board costs from the date that campus closed and students moved out. Others are issuing credits that students can use toward future costs.

Meanwhile, some disappointed students, such as those at the University of Minnesota, have campaigned for higher refunds via petitions, according to a U.S. News report. In fact, a handful of colleges are facing class action lawsuits for failing to refund money for the spring 2020 semester.

Even if your school isn’t issuing refunds currently, it might change its stance if enough students advocate for financial relief. Be sure to look into what’s available, as a refund now is preferable to having to seek student loan forgiveness later on down the road.

Beware of stimulus check scams

With policies changing rapidly, it can be hard to keep up with the options available. But make sure you’re getting your information from trusted sources so you don’t fall victim to a coronavirus crisis-related scam.

Note that the IRS will never call, text or email you asking for personal details or bank account numbers. If someone does contact you for sensitive information, it could very well be a scammer trying to steal your money or identity.

Along similar lines, avoid clicking on links in emails that claim to have “special information” about the economic relief checks. And before sharing any personal information, make absolutely sure you’re using an official tax return service or government website.

By keeping an eye out for suspicious requests, you can protect yourself from scam artists.

The presumptive Democratic nominee for president wants to cancel federal student loans for those earning less than $125,000

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) speaks about the Coronavirus and the response to it at the Hotel Du Pont in Wilmington, DE.- PHOTOGRAPH BY Michael Brochstein / Echoes Wire/ Barcroft Studios / Future Publishing (Photo credit should read Michael Brochstein / Echoes Wire/Barcroft Media via Getty Images)

Former Vice President Joe Biden is all but guaranteed to become the Democratic Party’s nominee for president of the United States this fall.

The seasoned politician now hopes to lead the fight to forgive student loans after beefing up his policy proposals for the matter in the wake of firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders‘ exit from the primary race. The plan also includes language specifically for people who attended Historically Black Colleges and Universities, according to Forbes.

“Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I’m proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis,” Biden said in a Medium post.

READ MORE: Sanders drops 2020 bid, leaving Biden as likely nominee

Biden rolled out the new plan on Thursday that details his desire to forgive federal student tuition-based debt for low-income and middle-class people that attended public institutions, including two- and four-year programs, with some exceptions. Private loans are not included in the policy proposal.

The exceptions to the rule are HBCUs and minority-serving institutions (MSI), which are made up of both public and private colleges. Some of the most recognizable HBCUs, including Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College, are private institutions.

Biden’s new forgiveness plan is directed to individuals who bring home less than $125,000 a year. Those who make less than $25,000 a year would not be asked to make monthly payments on public loans.

The plan is in part a response to the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden said he would pay for the debt cancellation by repealing an “excess business losses” tax cut that was part of the CARES Act, the bipartisan $2.2 trillion stimulus package signed by President Donald Trump last month. More details about the plan will come out in the future.

“That tax cut overwhelmingly benefits the richest Americans and is unnecessary for addressing the current COVID-19 economic relief efforts,” Biden wrote in the proposal.

Biden’s plan expands on his initial $750 billion policy proposal to address the mounting student debt crisis, which was centered on income-based repayment. Individuals making more than $25,000 would be asked to pay no more than 5% of discretionary income toward loan payments for 20 years. After meeting that obligation, all outstanding federal loan balances would be forgiven.

Biden has also voiced support for canceling at least $10,000 of student debt per person, which he adopted from former presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren‘s coronavirus response proposal.

By contrast, Sen. Sanders has voiced unyielding support for canceling all student debt, including federally backed and private loans.","The seasoned politician now hopes to lead the fight to forgive student loans after beefing up his policy proposals for the matter in the wake of firebrand Sen.

166,"pr 10, 2020",Black Enterprise,"Joe Biden Calls For Student Loan Forgiveness, Medicare Changes","Democratic presidential presumptive nominee Joe Biden released a new plan Thursday to forgive and eliminate student loan debt for millions of student borrowers.

According to Forbes, Biden’s plan would forgive all undergraduate federal student loan debt for borrowers who attended public colleges and universities, historically black colleges and universities, and private minority-serving institutions (MSIs). Borrowers that make less than $125,000 would also be eligible for loan forgiveness.

“I would finance this new student debt proposal by repealing the high-income ‘excess business losses’ tax cut in the CARES Act,” Biden wrote. “That tax cut overwhelmingly benefits the richest Americans and is unnecessary for addressing the current COVID-19 economic relief efforts.”

Additionally, Biden also supports Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s plan to restructure the bankruptcy code allowing student loan debt to be easily discharged in bankruptcy. Currently, student loan debt is treated differently from other forms of consumer debt in bankruptcy. Many feel that it’s time-consuming and difficult to meet the difficult “undue hardship” standard needed.

Biden’s new plan goes further than a previous plan he released last year. Political analysts see the new plan as an olive branch to align supporters of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and to consolidate the Democratic base.

Biden also released a plan to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from January 2019 almost 90% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans believe citizens as young as 50 should be allowed to buy into Medicare.

“It reflects the reality that, even after the current crisis ends, older Americans are likely to find it difficult to secure jobs,” Biden wrote of the plan. He added the plan would be financed “out of general revenues to protect the Medicare Trust Fund.”

Biden also supported a $10,000 federal student loan forgiveness plan as a response to the coronavirus outbreak. Senate Democrats proposed this idea, but Senate Republicans eliminated it from the final version of the CARES Act.

College students and the elderly are among the most impacted by the outbreak. College students were forced to rush off campus quickly and the elderly have been told in some states not to go outside. Luckily both have received some help. U-Haul provided free storage for students and celebrities have reached out to the elderly.","Democratic presidential presumptive nominee Joe Biden released a new plan Thursday to forgive and eliminate student loan debt for millions of student borrowers.

To learn more about your options, email or call your loan servicer ASAP. The sooner you ask for help, the sooner you’ll be able to get a break from your private student loan payments.

Just remember that interest will very likely continue to accrue on private student loans, meaning your balance will grow during a period of paused payments. But if you’re facing financial hardship, postponing payments could be exactly what you need right now to navigate this difficult time.

169,"pr 9, 2020",Stat News,A proper tribute to health care workers on the Covid-19 front lines: forgive their student loan debt,"Covid-19 has been likened to a stealth enemy attacking the fabric and well-being of our society. This epidemic has given rise to the largest federal stimulus package in history. As terms suggestive of wartime are being used to describe this clinical siege, clinicians working in the country’s hospitals and medical facilities represent the front line of defense.

Tragically, many of them are being sent to work ill-equipped and poorly protected. Reports of physicians, nurses, and other health care workers scrounging for protective equipment or using garbage bags as protective gowns, common office supplies as masks, or re-using masks — fearful of confusing the tainted side with the protective side — should concern everyone reliant on their valor.

In spite of shortages of supplies and the emotional toll of caring for a growing swell of individuals taken suddenly and critically ill, U.S. health care workers press on. They are creatively improvising in real time, trying to protect themselves and their families from their workplace risks. They are stripping their possibly contaminated clothes on doorsteps before entering their homes or apartments, they are sending their children to family members who are not in the medical profession, or separating themselves from their families in makeshift garages or basement “bunkers.”

Health care workers on the frontlines rightfully deserve the nation’s collective embrace and thanks.

Companies and philanthropic organizations are trying to supplement governmental efforts to fast-track the manufacture of needed equipment including gloves, masks, and gowns. These efforts, which deserve their own thanks, comprise one way to salute and support health care workers fighting Covid-19.

I believe there is another way the nation could tangibly recognize the selfless contributions of those on the medical frontlines. Many of those now exposing themselves to illness or worse are laboring under thousands upon thousands of dollars of student loan debt — the average is around $180,000 — accrued during their medical training. The nation should consider forgiving part or all of this debt for individuals working to keep us alive and well.

Soldiers in other wars were never asked to pay thousands of dollars before being sent to battle. We should honor the health care workers who are putting themselves at risk of infection as they care for patients with and without Covid-19 with the nation’s gratitude and easing their financial burdens by forgiving their student loan debt.

The fact that Joe Biden has just announced new policy proposals on access to health care and student-loan relief should come as zero surprise. As Greg Sargent points out, Biden is understandably absorbed with making multiple unity gestures toward supporters of Bernie Sanders immediately following his rival’s withdrawal from the race:

Now that Joe Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee, the question is: Can he mend fences with Bernie Sanders’ movement, or at least with a very sizable percentage of his voters?

The Biden campaign is now set to roll out its first major down payment on this effort, by announcing two new policy proposals that go farther than he had during the campaign. They may not go as far as Sanders would, but they’re still a striking move in his direction.

If anything, Sargent may be overestimating the extent to which these initiatives break new ground. On student loan debt, Biden is proposing to “forgive all student debt for low- and middle-income borrowers who attended public colleges or private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and private, underfunded Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs).” That’s a means-tested, targeted approach to a problem that Sanders and many other progressives consider universal and worthy of universal and prospective relief.

Biden is arguably moving even more deliberately on an issue that is absolutely essential to Sanders’s “revolution” and central to the crisis being generated by the coronavirus pandemic: health care.

In a well-timed essay today, Ezra Klein explained why current circumstances make Biden’s existing health-care proposal, based on adding a public option to Obamacare without disturbing employer-based insurance coverage, completely inadequate:

[D]isruptive change is here, whether anyone wants it or not. It won’t just be felt in the rising ranks of the uninsured, in the millions of people who lose the insurance provided by their workplace and have to scramble, desperately, for an alternative. It will also be felt by those who keep their job-based insurance, only to see it degrade as their employer rushes to cut costs …

Large employers are not allowed to buy into the new public option. Individuals can’t use the money their employer is spending on private health insurance to buy into the public option. What they’ve built isn’t a glide path to Medicare-for-all, or even to a new hybrid system. Instead, they’ve created a backstop to reinforce the current system, with all its flaws. And over the next year, the coronavirus is going to make those flaws gruesomely apparent.

Klein argues that Biden ought to adopt something like the Center for American Progress’s Medicare Extra proposal, which doesn’t abolish private insurance like Medicare for All but does allow both employers and employees to buy into a subsidized public program that adds a number of important protections to Medicare (and that would subsume the existing Medicaid and Obamacare programs). Medicare Extra also seeks to extend the federal government’s medical price-setting mechanisms into private insurance (i.e., all-payer rate-setting).

Biden’s announced new position today as described by Sargent doesn’t go remotely as far:

The first proposal is to lower the eligibility age for Medicare to 60, from its current 65 …

The Biden campaign’s idea is that this would make Medicare available to two groups: Those who work and retire before they turn 65, or those who are 60 and above who want to leave employer plans or other plans they access through the Affordable Care Act before they retire.

Like his original plan to offer a public option to the uninsured, Biden’s revised plan doesn’t do much for those whose employer-based insurance loses much of its value via higher premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and coverage restrictions — which, as Klein notes, is about to become a gigantic problem. The new initiative “reflects a particular reading of what our post-coronavirus crisis will look like, one in which ‘older Americans are likely to find it harder to secure jobs,’” according to Sargent.

Perhaps the best thing about Biden’s gesture is that it sounds exactly like that — a gesture, not a permanent position. He can expand both his student loan forgiveness and health-care proposals further without any major philosophical shifts. As Klein makes clear, there is particularly a lot of ground left between Biden’s revised health-care proposal and M4A. And because we are in a national economic and health-care crisis for the immediate future, nobody’s going to find too much fault with Biden for making adjustments. Indeed, he might want to do so daily to dramatize the stunning fact that the Trump administration still has no plan for expanding or protecting health-care coverage even as it continues to support the repeal of Obamacare.","Photo: Matt Rourke/AP/ShutterstockThe fact that Joe Biden has just announced new policy proposals on access to health care and student-loan relief should come as zero surprise.

171,"pr 9, 2020",Fox News,"Reaching out to left, Biden calls to lower Medicare age, forgive some student loan debt","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One day after Sen. Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden showcased new proposals to lower Medicare eligibility to age 60 and forgive student loan debt for low-income and middle-class families.

In unveiling his plans, the former vice president on Thursday credited the populist senator from Vermont and his legions of progressive and younger supporters for his embracement of the proposals.

SANDERS DUCKS QUESTION ON ENDORSING BIDEN IN FIRST INTERVIEW AFTER SUSPENDING CAMPAIGN

""Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I'm proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis,"" Biden said in a release.

Biden’s plan for Medicare -- the government-run health care system for those 65 and older -- would drop the eligibility age by five years, to 60. It would be available to those who work and retire before they turn 65 and those who are 60 or older and who want to leave their employer plans or health care coverage they’ve accessed through the Affordable Care Act before they retire.

The campaign says the move would give older Americans nearing the retirement age the ability to enjoy the benefits of the popular Medicare program. And Biden explained the proposal’s additional costs would “be financed out of general revenues to protect the Medicare Trust Fund.”

NEW POLLS INDICATE BIDEN HAS THE EDGE OVER TRUMP IN GENERAL ELECTION RACE

The former vice president also emphasized that “those who prefer to remain on their employer plans would be permitted to do so, and employers would have to comply with non-discrimination laws and would be prohibited from excluding older workers from coverage or otherwise try to push them out of their plans.”

He added that “the Biden Medicare-like public option” that he’s pushed on the campaign trail -- as well as subsidized private plans currently available to individuals through the ObamaCare health care exchanges -- would remain available.

The move is a significant step toward Sanders’ decades-old push for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" single-payer health care system, which was the senator’s signature domestic proposal in his 2020 presidential campaign. But it doesn’t go as far as Sanders’s plan, which calls for phasing in all Americans over a four-year period and phasing out private health insurance plans.

Biden said that his other plan would forgive student loan debt for those earning under $125,000 who attended public colleges, Historically Black Colleges or Universities (known as HBCUs) or private Minority-Serving Institutions (known as MSIs).

“This concept I’m announcing today will align my student debt relief proposal with my forward-looking college tuition proposal,” Biden said. “The federal government would pay the monthly payment in lieu of the borrower until the forgivable portion of the loan was paid off.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Biden’s proposal isn’t as comprehensive as Sanders’ plan to forgive all student debt, but it’s a move in that direction. It also follows the former vice president’s embracement two weeks ago of former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to also forgive up to $10,000 of anyone’s student debt right as part of coronavirus relief.

The announcements by Biden come as he courts Sanders and his supporters in the hope of unifying the party as the former vice president challenges President Trump in November’s general election.

While suspending his campaign on Wednesday, Sanders refrained from endorsing the former vice president and emphasized that he’ll remain on the Democratic primary ballot going forward “to assemble as many delegates as possible at the Democratic convention where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform and other functions.”

In an interview Wednesday night on CBS' ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Sanders said: “I hope to be able to work with Joe to move him in a more progressive direction.”

Talks between the two teams to discuss areas of policy agreements are getting underway. “The two campaigns continue to be engaged on a range of topics that would build on Vice President Biden's existing policy proposals and further our shared goals to move the country forward,” a senior Biden campaign official told Fox News on Thursday.

But if Biden starts steering too far to the left, he’ll invite a barrage of incoming fire from Republicans that he’s pushing a socialist agenda.

Within moments of Sanders' suspension on Wednesday, the president's reelection campaign went up with a digital ad highlighting similarities between the presumptive nominee and the democratic socialist.","One day after Sen.

Unfortunately, the federal government’s student loan interest waiver and repayment suspension announced in late March doesn’t help 100% of federal loan borrowers.

In fact, about 6 million Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) borrowers and a sizable fraction of the 2 million people with Perkins loans won’t qualify because of their loan type. And of course, private student loan borrowers aren’t eligible either.

It’s entirely possible that you have some loans that qualify for the coronavirus economic stimulus package and some that don’t — which makes it even more important to confirm your eligibility and understand how to seek relief for your ineligible debt. Specifically, let’s examine two questions:

Are you sure your loans aren’t eligible for relief?

Thanks to the coronavirus economic rescue bill, your loan servicer will automatically reduce your interest rate to zero and cancel all payments due through Sept. 30 if you have an eligible federal student loan. [Updated Aug. 9, 2021: The interest-free pause on most federal student loan repayment has been extended one final time until Jan. 31, 2022]

Eligible loans include all federally-held Direct loans, including Grad and Parent PLUS loans, as well as most FFELs (which haven’t been granted since 2010). That leaves the following loan types uncovered:

FFELs guaranteed by the federal government but held by a private entity

Perkins loans originated by your school

Private loans granted by banks, credit unions, state-run education authorities and online companies

Undoubtedly, the differences between a federal loan being “held” or merely “guaranteed” is bound to confuse. If you’re not sure what kind of loans you have, start by logging into the Federal Student Aid (FSA) website with your FSA ID to view all your federal loans.

A FFEL loan borrowed before 2010 is unlikely to meet criteria for relief. For any Perkins loans, you could clear up the confusion by calling your loan servicer directly or contacting your school’s financial aid office.

Finally, if you have education debt that doesn’t appear on the FSA website (and therefore isn’t owned or guaranteed by the Department of Education), call your lenders for those missing loans to confirm that your debt to them is categorized as private loans. You can also review your credit report to find the names of these lenders or loan servicers — the information is available for free via AnnualCreditReport.com.

How to handle repayment on loans ineligible for relief

If you have commercial or school-granted loans, you might think you’re out of luck. But there are a variety of ways to still pause or reduce your repayment, receive repayment assistance and generally manage your debt until the economy recovers:

Contact your lender or loan servicer immediately

It’s imperative to speak directly with your lender or loan servicer — not a third party, as that could leave you vulnerable to coronavirus student loan scams.

Of course, your repayment options will depend on your loan type.

For federal student loans ineligible for relief…

You could pause your monthly payments with a deferment or forbearance (unrelated to COVID-19):

A general forbearance that’s awarded at your servicer’s discretion, based on your financial constraints

that’s awarded at your servicer’s discretion, based on your financial constraints An unemployment deferment if you’ve lost your job

Alternatively, you could lower the monthly payments on your ineligible FFEL debt by enrolling in the Income-Sensitive Repayment plan to cap your dues at a percentage of your annual income. If you recently suffered a loss of income, you could apply for a recalculated (decreased) payment obligation.

Be aware, however, that interest will continue to accrue and capitalize during a forbearance, unless you have subsidized loans. And interest will also build up if you join an Income-Sensitive Repayment plan that lengthens your loan term.

For private student loans…

There are fewer (and usually less generous) options for private loans, but they do exist. These include:

Economic hardship or disaster-related forbearance: A pause in repayment that’s awarded on a case-by-case basis and doled out in one- to three-month spans.

A pause in repayment that’s awarded on a case-by-case basis and doled out in one- to three-month spans. Temporary payment reduction: Less common than forbearance, these payment reductions (like those offered by Discover) would lower your monthly dues for a brief period.

Less common than forbearance, these payment reductions (like those offered by Discover) would lower your monthly dues for a brief period. Temporary interest rate reduction: Navient , which services government-held federal loans eligible for the 0% interest rate but also provides ineligible federal and private loans, encourages borrowers affected by COVID-19 to apply for a lower rate.

That said, the options available have expanded as lenders seek to work with their customers during the coronavirus pandemic. You can check out what some of the biggest student loan companies are offering by consulting our list of forbearance options from private student loan companies during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Before agreeing to any changes to your loan agreement, ensure you understand the implications. Interrogate your lender or loan servicer with questions to make sure you understand how interest will pile up during a forbearance, for example. You might also ask about the length of time that a payment reduction could add to your overall repayment term. Then return to Student Loan Hero and use our loan repayment calculators to assess the consequences.

Consider a Direct Consolidation loan for your ineligible federal loans

You might have already discovered one workaround for your ineligible FFEL or Perkins loans: grouping them into a Direct Consolidation loan. Besides getting you covered for a portion of the 0% interest and payment-suspension period, consolidation would also deliver a single monthly payment and make you eligible for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans.

Consolidating with Uncle Sam might not be wise in certain cases, though. Here are three potential cons to be aware of:

It would erase your progress toward the consecutive-payment criteria for a program like Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Outstanding interest on your loans will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when you consolidate. You’ll likely miss at least the first two months of the government’s six-month payment suspension. While applying for a Direct Consolidation loan takes less than a half-hour, actually receiving it would take a minimum of 30 days, and likely longer.

If you’re on the fence about consolidation, speak with your loan servicer. You can also review our guide about deciding whether consolidation is right for you.

Look into refinancing at least your ineligible private loans

Like consolidation, refinancing would group your student debt into one new loan. But while it still won’t grant you access to the government’s interest-rate freeze and payment suspension, refinancing could reward you with a lower interest rate or a monthly payment (or both) more suited to your ability to repay.

These potential benefits generally make refinancing a great option for your private student loans — all the more so as refinancing companies are now offering relatively low rates after the COVID-19 outbreak prompted emergency rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. If you have strong credit (or have a cosigner who does), you could refinance your existing private debt with a new lender, perhaps one that also offers some coronavirus pandemic refinancing relief.

However, know that there are pros and cons to refinancing, so don’t rush into refinancing (and privatizing) FFEL and Perkins loans that aren’t currently eligible for the federal relief package. The biggest consideration is that once your refinance, any federal loans will lose their government protections, such as IDR and expanded deferment and forbearance options. You also wouldn’t be eligible for any future government relief, unless it applies to private education debt.

Talk to your employer about pitching in toward payments

If you have federal or private loans that don’t qualify for the student loan interest waiver and payment suspension, now’s the time to bring up your student debt concerns with your human resources department.

As part of the coronavirus economic rescue package, the government gave employers temporary tax relief for contributing up to $5,250 toward their employees’ student loan payments. This benefit is slated to stay until at least Jan. 1, 2021, and it could cover any student debt, whether federal or private.

It’s worth noting that many major companies provide student debt relief already.

Stay tuned to Student Loan Hero

Sure, your commercially-held federal loans and private loans are mostly unaccounted for in the government’s new relief package, but they could be affected by future legislation.

As recently as March 19, for example, Congressional Democrats were pushing for $10,000 or more in forgiveness for federal loan borrowers. It’s not clear whether such a plan will come to pass, but the magnitude of it makes it worth keeping an eye on.

We’ll keep you posted on developments via our Student Loan Hero news reports and our Coronavirus Information Center. The FSA website’s updates sometimes lag behind other news sources, but it’s worth bookmarking as well.

173,"pr 7, 2020",InvestmentNews,Cares Act student-loan relief has few takers,"Employers can pay down their workers’ student loans by more than $5,000 this year, tax free, under a provision in the Cares Act. But a big question is whether many would even consider doing so in the current economy.

Included in the recently passed relief is a quirk that allows companies that make payments toward their employees’ student loans to contribute as much as $5,250 through Dec. 31, with that money not counting toward workers’ taxable income. For people who have jobs and are struggling to pay their loans, that could be great news.

Across industries, however, companies are laying off or furloughing millions of workers. And many are reducing or eliminating the contributions they make to their employees’ 401(k)s.

“Most employers right now are struggling. Most individuals are struggling,” said Tara Fung, chief commercial officer at student-loan provider CommonBond. But, “We do recognize that right now, there are some companies that are struggling with staffing needs, where this benefit could be helpful.”

For the sectors that are not suffering financially, such as grocery chains, health care businesses, some tech firms, there has been interest, Fung said.

“We are speaking with a few employers right now,” she said. “They’re open to considering this.”

Student loan assistance has increasingly been added by employers as a way to attract and retain workers. This year, CommonBond added a service that lets companies make 401(k) contributions on behalf of employees who are paying down student loans, but not deferring any of their pay toward the retirement plan.

The employer student-loan provision is not the only aspect of the Cares Act designed to help alleviate workers’ college-debt woes amid the pandemic. The new law also allowed grads to suspend payments on federal student loans through September.

More than 60% of people with student loans said they are worried about their ability to make payments in the current economy, according to a recent survey of 1,000 Americans commissioned by LendEDU. More than 20% of people surveyed said they were currently paying down such loans.

That speaks to the appeal of employer-provided student-loan assistance.

Student loan burdens

The tax-free contribution provision in the Cares Act is not new — it stemmed from separate legislation to fix an “outdated part of the tax code” that has been introduced in Congress three times, Fung said. The provision extends the current tax treatment of employer-provided tuition assistance to student loan contributions, she noted.

“Overwhelmingly, this is just good legislation that was passed at a time when there was a lot going on, which is why it’s being put under a microscope,” she said. “This is meant to help people with student debt.”

One client, a cosmetics company with about 5,000 employees, would benefit, Fung said. That company had implemented a student-loan payment benefit of $50 per month for workers, but many turned it down, given the tax consequences, she said.

“They couldn’t take the hit to their take-home pay,” she said. “They would see a decrease of roughly $15.”

A separate benefit of the temporary Cares Act provision is that it requires employers to perform non-discrimination testing to help ensure that highly compensated employees do not disproportionately benefit, Fung said. For the taxable student loan contributions prior to the Cares Act, such testing was not required, she noted. That kind of testing is required for retirement plans such as 401(k)s, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

Navigating the crisis

For companies that are interested in making payments this year to employees’ student loans, it could be several weeks or months before they act, according to two retirement plan record keepers.

“Many employers right now are trying to navigate the bigger impacts of Cares,” said Asha Srikantiah, head of student debt at Fidelity Investments. “We are in communication with them about it, [but] it is still early days.”

“Many student-debt borrowers that work for companies that provide this type of benefit would obviously love for this to be extended [beyond 2020],” she said.

Another firm, Empower Retirement, is also supportive of the provision being extended, a spokesperson said in an email.

“We believe this is an important benefit that could help student loan borrowers over the long term,” he said. “Many clients have expressed interest in this new provision, however there is currently a greater plan sponsor focus on other issues related to the Cares Act and the more immediate needs of plan participants.”","Employers can pay down their workers’ student loans by more than $5,000 this year, tax free, under a provision in the Cares Act.

174,"pr 6, 2020",Chicago Sun-Times,Federal student loans are paused for 6 months — should you pay anyway?,"Federal student loan borrowers will see payments automatically suspended — without incurring interest on them — for six months, according to a measure included in federal stimulus package released last month. This policy applies only to federal loans, not to private student loans.

This option, called a forbearance, will run through Sept. 30. You will be notified of the option to continue making payments toward the principal. Contact your servicer if you have further questions.

Make no mistake: This is a pause on payments, not forgiveness. Your debt will be waiting for you when repayment begins at the end of the six-month forbearance, unless the policy changes.

And the policy could well change. The measures were made as part of the federal stimulus bill in response to the economic fallout related to the spread of coronavirus, and COVID-19, the illness it causes. Neither the outbreak nor its economic impact shows signs of slowing, and some lawmakers have proposed more dramatic measures.

“I do think there’s going to be additional waves of relief, depending on how this pandemic plays out,” says Betsy Mayotte, president and founder of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors.

Until then, here’s how to decide what to do next.

If you want to pause payments

You don’t have to do anything to get a forbearance to stop student loan payments for six months, which begin in April. You can call your servicer to request a forbearance before then, which would be retroactive to March 13. Interest won’t continue to accrue, as it normally would.

A forbearance could give you breathing room to address other financial concerns.

If you are jobless or working reduced hours, a forbearance may free up cash to pay the rent and utilities or grocery bills. Even if your pay is unaffected, a forbearance could help you divert some money toward building an emergency fund or help you pay another, more pressing debt.

NerdWallet.com is a personal finance website and app.

Usually forbearance is granted at the discretion of the servicer and interest will continue to build. In this case, the Education Department has instructed all servicers to automatically place all loans into a six-month forbearance, and due to the waiver, no interest will grow.

If you’re behind on your student loan payments (or get behind)

Payments are automatically suspended for all borrowers, including those who are more than 31 days delinquent prior to March 13 and those who become more than 31 days delinquent in the coming days. That means the loans are placed in forbearance and won’t default.

Default on federal loans happens when a payment is 270 days past due, sending your loan to collections and exposing you to damaged credit, garnished wages and seized tax refunds.

For borrowers in loan rehabilitation, each month of the forbearance period would also count toward rehabilitation.

For those with federal student loans in default, all collection activities are suspended. You can get a refund for any forced student loan payments made since March 13. If your tax refund was seized before March 13, it will not be returned.

If your loans are already in forbearance, any interest that already accrued will still be added to your loan principal when your repayment begins, but during the six-month waiver no new interest will be calculated.

If you are seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness

A forbearance won’t undo your progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness, or PSLF. During the automatic forbearance, as long as you are still working with a qualifying employer, those six months will count toward PSLF.

Making payments during the forbearance won’t get you ahead on payments. You’re in the same boat whether you pay or not.

Under normal circumstances only full payments count. You also won’t lose credit for the payments you already made.

If you want to continue making payments

Borrowers might want to continue making payments on federal loans if they want to pay down their debt faster.

The stimulus bill states that borrowers will be given the option to continue making payments toward the principal, but otherwise all loans will be placed in forbearance.

If you do continue making payments, you won’t pay any new interest on your loans for six months, retroactive to President Donald Trump’s original March 13 announcement temporarily suspending student loan interest. This 0% interest rate will save you money overall, even though your payment won’t be lower.

The full amount of your payment will be applied to the principal balance of your loan once all interest accrued prior to the president’s announcement is paid.

Contact your loan servicer with any questions about continuing or restarting payments during the forbearance period.

If your income has changed

If you experience a change in income and still want to keep your payments going, the best way to lower your payment to something more affordable is to apply for income-driven repayment. You’ll get a new payment that is based on your family size and a percentage of discretionary income, and it will be in effect even after the stimulus relief has expired. You can apply online at studentaid.gov.

How to work with your servicer

If you want to restart payments during the automatic forbearance, contact your student loan servicer — it’s the private company that manages payment of your federal loans. But you don’t have to do anything to get the forbearance or the 0% interest rate.

Mayotte encourages borrowers to be patient with their servicers.

“These are unprecedented times, and I can assure you the servicers did not have a lot of notice,” says Mayotte.

To find out which loan servicer is yours, log in to studentaid.gov with your FSA ID.

175,"pr 4, 2020",WUSA9.com,VERIFY: Sallie Mae student loan borrowers get a break during COVID-19 crisis,"Sallie Mae is offering 3-month payment breaks during the coronavirus pandemic, but there's still interest.

WASHINGTON — THE QUESTION:

Sallie Mae is giving a three-month payment forgiveness period on private student loans for the coronavirus emergency. But will the loan's interest still accrue?

THE ANSWER:

Yes, interest will still accrue, according to Sallie Mae spokeswoman Ashley Boucher.

WHAT WE FOUND:

Boucher said borrowers in financial difficulty from the pandemic can request a three-month suspension of student loan payments.

Interest will accrue, but it will not be “capitalized,” she said. This means that the interest is not added to the principal balance of the loan. In other words, someone won’t pay interest on the interest.

Even if there wasn't a COVID-19 pandemic, customers in financial distress could contact Sallie Mae to try and arrange new terms for their loan.

“We work with them to understand their financial circumstances and identify any available alternative arrangements designed to reduce monthly payment obligations,” Boucher said.

She said Sallie Mae is emailing all customers to let them know assistance is available.

Customers can contact Sallie Mae through chat with a customer service representative at SallieMae.com, via its app, or by calling 800-4-SALLIE (800-472-5543).

176,"pr 3, 2020",Money,Millions of Student Loan Borrowers Don't Qualify for the Coronavirus Relief Program. Here's How to Know If You're One of Them,"About 8 million borrowers will still owe monthly payments on their federal student loans, despite Congress pausing payments for the majority of federal student loan borrowers.

The CARES Act, the $2.3 trillion relief package President Trump signed into law last week, includes a provision that gives an interest-free, six-month forbearance period on many student loans. The key is that the loans must be “federally held,"" as opposed to ""federally guaranteed.""

Non-covered loans account for about 12% of the federal loan portfolio, according to The Institute for College Access and Success.

Those who are affected include at least 6 million borrowers with older loans, specifically commercially held Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), according to Money's estimates. And some of the 1.9 million Perkins loans, many of which are owned by colleges, are also not covered. (Note that in both cases, those borrowers may also have some loans that are covered by the CARES Act.)

There’s no doubt this will be confusing for borrowers, consumer advocates say. The average borrower likely doesn’t know whether their loans are “federally held” or “federally guaranteed.” And the best way to get a personalized answer, according to the Education Department, is to go through your servicer. Yet those companies, which manage repayment for the government, are scrambling to update their systems and train their call center staffs a short timeline.

In short: If you took out a loan before 2010, then you took out a FFEL Program loan, and that means there’s a strong chance those loans do not qualify for the suspended payments, says Jason Delisle, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who's studied the federal loan program.

Why Certain Loans Aren’t Covered

There’s no official word from Congress or the Education Department why these loans are not included. But experts suspect it would have added another layer of complexity that lawmakers chose to avoid in a package that was already quite complex.

In fact, all sides were pushing for all federal loans to be covered, from consumer advocates to the servicers themselves, says Michele Streeter, a policy analyst with The Institute for College Access and Success. And before the CARES Act was finalized, many Democrats were rallying around a proposal that would cover all loans (as well as give up to $10,000 in forgiveness).

“There really isn’t any logical reason why they wouldn’t be included,” Streeter says, other than it’d be more complicated to arrange.

That’s because while these loans are counted in the federal government’s portfolios, they are actually owned by private companies and banks. But they are guaranteed by the federal government, which means the government is ultimately on the hook for those loans if a borrower fails to repay.

Congress likely didn't want to be in a position to have to give cash payments to the lenders to make them whole during the six-month period, Delisle says.

What You Can Do If You Loans Aren’t Covered

If your loans are not covered, you still have a couple different options. The downside is you’ll have to proactively call your servicer and do the math to figure out which path is best for you, Streeter says.

“There are options for pausing, but it’s a little bit more complicated and less of an easy calculation as to whether it’s the right move,” she says.

You could consolidate your Federal Family Education Loans into the Direct Loan program to access the 0% interest and six-month payment freeze. But there’s a couple of potential downsides to that: First, if you were working toward loan forgiveness after making a certain number of payments, the clock starts over when you consolidate. So if you’ve made several years of payments on an income-based plan, you probably don’t want to do that, says Betsy Mayotte, founder of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors.

There’s also the fact that consolidation generally takes 45 to 60 days to complete, she says. And after you consolidate, depending on your current interest rate, you may have to pay a higher one when the 0% period ends in the fall. Any unpaid interest you have before you consolidate will capitalize as well.

The other option is to request a normal forbearance. That’s a protection that’s always available to federal borrowers. In most cases, your interest will still accrue. But forbearance can last of a long time, and it’s relatively easy to sign up for. You can usually do it on the phone with your servicer.

If you’ve lost your job or seen your hours cut to below 30 a week, Mayotte recommends the unemployment deferment. If you have a subsidized loan, interest will not accrue in that program, which makes it better than a regular forbearance. You'll have to fill out an application, and it typically takes a couple weeks for those to be approved, she says.

One final note, Mayotte says she's seen a ""mixed bag"" in terms of borrowers getting in touch with and accurate information from servicers in the past two weeks. As it's only been a week since the law passed, some haven't trained all of their call center staff with the most up-to-date information. As a result, Mayotte is telling all the borrowers she works with to wait until April 10—the date the Education Department said servicers will have the program ready—to call their servicer.

In an unprecedented move, the US government is automatically suspending payments and waiving interest on federal student loans for six months, providing immediate relief for more than 20 million people currently paying off their debt.

By Katie Lobosco, CNN

(CNN) -- In an unprecedented move, the US government is automatically suspending payments and waiving interest on federal student loans for six months, providing immediate relief for more than 20 million people currently paying off their debt.

But the change, which was included in the $2 trillion economic stimulus package signed into law last week by President Donald Trump, came fast and it's taking some time for some loan servicers to update their guidance.

It's creating some confusion for borrowers, many of whom may be newly unemployed and in need of relief. Part of the uncertainty stems from the fact that the President first announced a similar, but more limited, debt relief plan for borrowers. Two weeks later, the congressional legislation extended the forbearance period from 60 days to six months and made the suspension of payments automatic.

The Department of Education has also announced that the waivers would be implemented retroactively to March 13. Any borrower who has made a payment since then can request a refund.

Still, the student loan repayment system is complex. Here's what you need to know about who qualifies and how it works with existing loan forgiveness plans:

No, you don't need to request a forbearance

The legislation made the suspension of payments automatic. That will remain in place until September 30. The change will take effect retroactively to March 13, but it could take some time for it to show up on your account.

The Department of Education said it directed servicers to implement the changes by April 10 -- but some borrowers may still be seeing outdated information.

""It takes time to train people and get correct guidance out,"" said Betsy Mayotte, the founder of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, which created a resource to help borrowers understand the new changes.

""I've been in this industry through a lot of disasters, 9/11 and Katrina, and these waivers are like nothing I've seen before,"" she added.

The interest waiver will also go into effect automatically.

Most people qualify, but not everyone

The six-month suspension and interest waiver applies only to federally held loans, which covers roughly 85% of federal student loans. That includes loans known as Direct federal loans, as well as PLUS loans that parents may have taken out on behalf of their children.

It excludes some federal loans that are guaranteed by the government by not technically held by it. Generally, those were disbursed prior to 2010. About half of those with loans known as Federal Family Education Loans won't qualify, according to government data.

Loan servicers should be able to tell borrowers which loans are eligible and at least one is offering some relief to those with non-qualifying loans. Navient says it will postpone payments for three months for those who request it.

Private student loans are also excluded from the payment suspension and interest waivers, but some banks are offering debt relief to borrowers during the pandemic. For example, they may charge a fee for the ability to postpone payments for a period of time.

""If someone is struggling, they should absolutely call their lender,"" Mayotte said.

A benefit for those seeking loan forgiveness

There's a bonus for those borrowers who were already enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program or another federal forgiveness plan.

They won't have to make their payments over the next six months, and they will still receive credit toward the forgiveness program as if they had -- as long as they are still working full time for a qualifying employer.

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program requires 120 monthly payments before borrowers see their remaining debt wiped away. Borrowers will knock off six of those without paying through September.

Collections on defaulted debt will stop

The legislation suspends collections on defaulted federally owned loans, including wage and tax refund garnishment. Defaulted loans will not accrue interest through September.

The Department of Education is also refunding any garnishments made since March 13. It has said that 830,000 borrowers will receive $1.8 billion back.

You can still keep paying on your loans

If you can afford to keep making your payments, you can do so. But auto-debits have been suspended. You may need to contact your servicer to make manual payments.

Your payments won't be lower than they normally are. The full amount of any payment should be applied to principal once all interest accrued prior to March 13 is paid.

If you’ve been walloped by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, taking advantage of the federal student loan repayment suspension and interest freeze is a no-brainer. You can now stop making your payments and enjoy the six-month, interest-free period handed down by the U.S. government.

But what if you can afford to keep putting money toward your education debt? For you, taking advantage of the federal student loan interest freeze might mean something else entirely.

Here’s how to know…

When it makes sense to keep making federal loan payments

As you’ve likely heard, the government has enacted a six-month suspension of student loan payments — technically, an “administrative forbearance” — that allows most federal loan borrowers to take a penalty-free break from payment through Jan. 31, 2022.

And yet, continuing to make payments could be wise in the following scenarios:

1. You can still afford your monthly payment

2. You can afford a portion of your monthly payment

1. You can still afford your monthly payment

By continuing to make your usual monthly payment, you could take advantage of the federal student loan interest freeze instead of letting it pass you by. The upside to continuing your repayment is that you’ll now make much quicker progress toward a zero balance, thanks to the fact that 100% of your payment would be applied toward your principal balance.

Typically, loan servicers apply payments to fees, interest and then the principal (in that order). The lower your principal balance becomes during the federal student loan interest freeze, the less interest you’ll owe once it ends — that is how student loan interest works.

Say for example, you have a federal student loan balance of $33,545 (currently the national average) and a monthly payment of $276. Instead of having $158 of that $276 payment go toward the interest that accrued over the past month, all $276 would go directly toward your balance, whittling it down faster.

2. You can afford a portion of your monthly payment

The math here might be less impactful, but still potentially meaningful, as 100% of whatever you can afford to pay would go straight to decreasing your principal balance.

Talk to your federal loan servicer in this case. You could elect to keep your current repayment plan and submit a fraction of your original amount due each month. You might even ask your employer about helping you fill out the remainder of your payment — Congress has allowed employers to contribute up to $5,250 tax-free to employees’ student debt through the end of 2025.

Whether you receive employer-offered repayment assistance or not, you could also explore income-driven repayment (IDR) that would automatically cap your monthly payment as a percentage of your discretionary income (once repayment obligations resume in October). You could qualify for a monthly payment of as low as $0, depending on your income and family size.

Enrolling in an IDR would also ensure you sidestep delinquency or default come the fall season when payments are due again. It could lengthen your repayment term, however, leading to greater overall interest charge in the years ahead.

When it makes sense to stop repayment during the federal student loan freeze

If you’ve lost a job, have unpaid medical bills or have suffered another hardship, it’s likely wise to take the penalty-free pause on your federal student loans.

It might be less obvious, however, that you should also sit back in the following situations:

1. You drained your emergency fund

2. You have higher-interest debt to fend off

3. You’re working toward federal loan forgiveness

1. You drained your emergency fund

Knowing when to save money or pay off student debt is no easy question. The typical advice is to have three to six months’ worth of funds for your family’s expenses socked away for tough times. And in an unprecedented crisis such as the current coronavirus-affected economy, you and your family might want to lean toward the larger end of that spectrum.

If you’ve had to use some or all of your emergency fund already, it would likely be wise to rebuild it before resuming your federal loan repayment. This way, you’ll have a much better chance of affording your monthly payment once the clock runs out on the federal student loan payment suspension and interest freeze.

Say your emergency fund is half-full as a result of the coronavirus crisis. If you can replenish it in three months, you could always return to your repayment at the four-month mark. And if it takes six months, you might be better off staying on the sidelines until Jan. 31, 2022.

Instead of sitting back and relaxing, however, look at the federal student loan interest freeze as another new grace period. To make the most of it, start planning for how you’ll handle your repayment when it resumes. You might recession-proof your strategy, for example, if your job status isn’t as solid as it used to be.

Do you need to ask for the special administrative forbearance? The massive coronavirus economic rescue package mandated that a six-month, interest-free forbearance be awarded automatically. While you don’t need to ask for it, it wouldn’t hurt to contact your loan servicer and talk through your options. You can track down your loan servicer here if you’re not sure who manages the debt.

2. You have higher-interest debt to fend off

Among the financial goals to prioritize before paying off student debt, ridding yourself of high-interest debt is at the top of the list.

With the federal student loan interest freeze in effect, you might also be seeking a break on your credit card or auto loan payments (particularly if the interest rates are in double digits). Short of that relief, it’s probably smart to prioritize paying off your higher-interest debt first, as called for by the debt avalanche method of debt management.

You might feel like you’ll miss out on potential savings by not contributing to your federal loan balances. But look on the bright side: As part of the March 27 economic rescue measures, your suspended payments will count as on-time and in-full payments, as reported by your loan servicer to the consumer credit agencies. Your credit score won’t be harmed — and, in fact, could be helped — by the federal student loan interest freeze.

Just be aware that you’ll have to re-enroll in autopay with your servicer once the federal student loan payment suspension ends.

3. You’re working toward federal loan forgiveness

Suspended payments still count toward achieving federal loan forgiveness, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). If you’re progressing toward such relief, you’re likely already enrolled in an income-driven repayment program to keep your monthly payment low — and your ultimate forgiveness amount high.

Keep the same mindset during the federal student loan interest freeze. Even with repayment halted through Jan. 31, 2022, the payments you would have made do still count toward the 120 needed to reach the finish line — it’s as if you had made those payments anyway.

Say you’re among the 1.1 million-plus borrowers currently pursuing PSLF, according to our student debt data. You could add a good number of “payments” to your existing tally of the 120 straight timely payments to qualify for forgiveness.

One piece of fine print to sort through: You’d still have to fulfill other requirements of PSLF, such as working full-time for an eligible employer.","Student Loan Hero is a completely free website 100% focused on helping student loan borrowers get the answers they need.

180,"pr 2, 2020",PlanSponsor,Employers Can Offer More Student Loan Repayment Help to Employees,"Laurel Taylor, founder and CEO of FutureFuel.io in San Francisco, says the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act included two provisions that are critical to helping Americans with student loan debt.

“Section 2206 passed into law a bill we had been heavily engaged with,” she says. “It allows employers to make payments up to $5,250 toward employees’ student loans tax-free through end of this year.”

Kate Winget, managing director of Gradifi by E*TRADE in Boston, explains that this means the payments do not have to be included as income for employees for tax purposes. “Previously, when employers made such contributions, they were considered taxable income,” she says.

The second provision helpful to those with student loan debt is in Section 3513. “It empowers all borrowers on federal repayment plans to suspend payments through September 30,” Taylor says, adding that interest on student loans will not accrue from now until September 30.

Further, for those on public forgiveness programs, or on a schedule of 120 qualified payments, the time when payments are suspended will not negatively impact their ability to stay on the program. “It is treated as though the borrower has continued to make payments, which is absolutely critical to keep borrowers on the right track,” Taylor says.

“Borrowers are more confused than ever in terms of what their options are—what they can do and what they should do,” she adds. She suggests employers provide subject matter expertise to participants to help them understand the provisions passed in the CARES Act, send out communications to make them aware of their abilities, and tell them to call their student loan servicer to communicate their preference regarding deferring payments.

Winget notes that, previously, employers didn’t have to have a separate benefit plan document to make payments toward employees’ student loans;, it was just considered income. She suggests that employers now document what they are doing and review it with the tax advisers and legal counsel. “We’re still sorting through what’s going to be required and will continue to share what we learn,” Winget says.

Employers that don’t already have a student loan repayment program in place can reach out to providers. For example, BenefitEd, a joint venture between Ameritas and Nelnet offering customized student loan repayment and college savings programs to companies of all sizes, announced it will begin working with employers to offer tax-advantaged student loan repayment programs.

FutureFuel.io has launched a platform called Reassess to help student loan borrowers get on the right repayment plan. In just 3 1/2 minutes, the tool lists all the repayment plans a person is eligible for based on five questions and allows him to sign and submit an application online. The company says, on average, borrowers save $254 a month by getting on a payment program that is commensurate with income. “Getting on the right repayment plan is critical because even if borrowers choose to defer payments as they can under the CARES Act, their payments must resume,” Taylor says, adding that she is seeing a surge in employees shifting to income-driven payment plans.

To Defer or Not to Defer

While many borrowers may have no choice but to defer their student loan payments as the coronavirus pandemic has created a surge in unemployment, those who are not adversely financially affected have other options.

Taylor says it is a great opportunity for people who can continue to make payments because the relief in the CARES Act means those payments will have roughly twice the impact right now in terms of decreasing student debt. “One hundred percent of payments made by either employees or employers until September 30 will go to the principal on the loan. It’s a bit of gamification on compound interest,” she explains.

Another option for those who can still afford the payments is to accept the deferral opportunity and pay their student loan payment into an emergency fund. “This can be an opportunity to take a breath and make some progress on emergency savings, then resume payments on an appropriate repayment plan based on income,” Taylor says.

Whatever employees decide to do, Winget says allowing employers to help with employees’ student loan repayments has had great support across both sides of the aisle in Congress. She is optimistic that the CARES Act provision will be extended.

“Including [Section 2206] in an historic stimulus package signals to plan sponsors and providers that benefits to address student debt in the workplace are here to stay,” Taylor says. “It should be anticipated that Section 2206 will be made permanent in a tax extender.”



She noted that the IRS issued a private letter ruling (PLR) to the firm Abbott about amending its retirement plan to offer a student loan benefit program, under which it would make an employer nonelective contribution on behalf of an employee conditioned on that employee making student loan repayments. Lawmakers have introduced a bill that would allow all 401(k), 403(b) and SIMPLE [savings incentive match plan for employees] retirement plan sponsors to use their plans to provide student loan repayment benefits to employees. “I look for lawmakers to pass such legislation. I can feel the momentum building,” Taylor says.","The second provision helpful to those with student loan debt is in Section 3513.

181,"pr 2, 2020",Diverse: Issues in Higher Education,Report Gauges Support for Student Loan Forgiveness Across Political Lines,"The combination of a coronavirus-halted economy, an upcoming election and an ever-mounting student debt crisis has thrust the topic of student loan forgiveness to the forefront of the national conversation in recent weeks.

But just who — and who doesn’t — support student loan forgiveness? The answer may not be as bipartisan as previously assumed, suggests a study published by College Finance, which surveyed more than 1,100 Americans across party affiliations, ages and debt status.

When asked the general question, ‘Would you support a student loan forgiveness program?’ opinions typically fell along party lines, with 84% of Democratic respondents expressing some degree of support as opposed to 50% of Republicans reporting similar support.

However, with regard to the thornier facets of student loan forgiveness — its ethics, its feasibility and the specific policies of it — party lines became more blurred, says John Bernasconi, a project manager for College Finance.

“We were pleasantly surprised to uncover the extent to which our participants’ beliefs and preferences defied strict party lines, as well as their willingness to acknowledge points that contradict or challenge the position on student loan forgiveness that we support,” wrote Bernasconi in an email to Diverse.

He said that because student debt relief is often spoken of in “all or nothing” and “good and bad” terms, the objective of the study was “to dig deeper.”

So, the authors “dug deeper” by asking questions regarding seven specific policies related to student debt forgiveness, ranging from complete forgiveness of student debt, to income-based forgiveness, to forgiveness of student loan interest. What they found was that 81% of Republican respondents supported at least one of the forgiveness plans — a significant jump from the 50% of Republicans who had said they would support student loan forgiveness.

Additionally, the study also asked respondents how realistic they felt each policy plan was, revealing stark differences between support and perceived feasibility among Democrats. For instance, although 80% of Democrats supported complete forgiveness, only 34% felt it was realistic. Alternatively, when presented with an “income-based, month-by-month payment forgiveness” plan, perceived feasibility among Democrats skyrocketed to 76%.

Interestingly, regardless of party affiliation, those with student debt were more likely to view the forgiveness plans as realistic, causing the authors to question whether “optimism about political change” is a common coping strategy for living under the weight of debt.

The study then asked about potential benefits and drawbacks of student loan forgiveness, tackling questions such as who would unintentionally benefit or suffer from student loan forgiveness. Here, too, they found similarities across party lines.

For instance, a majority of Democrats and Republicans — 66% and 81%, respectively — felt that student loan forgiveness would not address the root cause of high education costs. And, similarly, 52% of Democrats and 69% of Republicans acknowledged that it could possibly reward colleges that have unfairly raised education costs.

The study also raised questions of ethics and fairness, such as, “Is loan forgiveness fair to those who had made cost-conscious education choices?” Such questions have inspired heated debate. On this issue, the authors found bipartisan lines forming again, with 75% of Republicans and 46% of Democrats saying forgiveness would be unfair to those who made cost-conscious choices.

Likewise, 73% of Republicans, as opposed to 43% of Democrats, said forgiveness would transfer tax revenue from “responsible people” to “irresponsible people.”

However, when asked whether offering large loans to teenagers fresh out of high school was exploitative, the margin of difference between parties shrunk again, with 67% of Democrats and 55% of Republicans answering “yes.”

Additionally, both parties’ supporters, for a total of 83% overall, appeared to especially agree on one thing: that student debt impacts the quality of life for young adults, preventing them from reaching milestones in life, such as marriage or children.

“Political issues such as student loan forgiveness are complicated and nuanced, and we were delighted to see these qualities reflected in the responses of our participants,” said Bernasconi. “Many people across the political spectrum demonstrated knowledge, consideration and understanding of the underlying aspects of student loan forgiveness.”

Meanwhile, one author of the study said support for student loan forgiveness will likely gain more traction as the coronavirus spreads throughout the U.S. and has a significant financial toll on millions of Americans. The study was conducted shortly before the coronavirus began to emerge as a worldwide threat.

“If I had to speculate, I’d say the coronavirus is likely to make most categories of respondents more supportive of student loan forgiveness provisions than they were prior to the onset of the crisis,” said Kristyn Pilgrim in an email to Diverse. “There is a general understanding that COVID-19 will result in sudden, high unemployment rates that are likely to impact younger workers who are more likely to hold student loan debt. At the moment, the public is generally supportive of broad government intervention to financially support broad segments of the population, especially the most vulnerable.”","The combination of a coronavirus-halted economy, an upcoming election and an ever-mounting student debt crisis has thrust the topic of student loan forgiveness to the forefront of the national conversation in recent weeks.
But just who — and who doesn’t — support student loan forgiveness?
He said that because student debt relief is often spoken of in “all or nothing” and “good and bad” terms, the objective of the study was “to dig deeper.”So, the authors “dug deeper” by asking questions regarding seven specific policies related to student debt forgiveness, ranging from complete forgiveness of student debt, to income-based forgiveness, to forgiveness of student loan interest.
The study then asked about potential benefits and drawbacks of student loan forgiveness, tackling questions such as who would unintentionally benefit or suffer from student loan forgiveness.
“Political issues such as student loan forgiveness are complicated and nuanced, and we were delighted to see these qualities reflected in the responses of our participants,” said Bernasconi."
182,"pr 2, 2020",CBS News,Which borrowers are getting help under CARES Act — and which aren't,"The $2.2 trillion financial relief package President Donald Trump signed into law last week, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Security (CARES) Act, offers many Americans a break on their loans as the coronavirus slams the economy. But not everyone will get a helping hand, and many consumer advocates think the law doesn't provide enough relief.

The CARES Act ""won't stop severe consequences for American families who are struggling with debt, have little to no savings, are being crushed by the economic fallout,"" National Consumer Law Center Associate Director Lauren Saunders said in a statement last week.

Here's why: The stimulus package mandates loan forgiveness for many publicly backed loans, but it does not require private lenders or major banks to offer loan relief to struggling borrowers.

Read on to learn about what kind of debt relief borrowers are getting under the CARES Act.

Student loans

Loan relief: Substantial. The CARES Act suspends payments on federally backed student loans until September 30.

Who's in: That covers about 80% of all student loans, and borrowers won't be charged any interest until September 30.

Not paying your loan also won't hurt your credit report or your credit score. In fact, the stimulus law requires lenders to continue to report every month that borrowers are current on their loans and making payments even if they have temporarily suspended those payments.

Who's out: The CARES Act provides little help for private student loans, which are held by about 9 million Americans and make up about 20% of the student loan market.

""The Senate picked winners and losers by giving certain federal student loan borrowers a short break from making payments, from interest accrual and from involuntary collection, but withholding that help from others,"" the National Consumer Law Center said in a review of the coronavirus economic relief bill.

Mortgage loans

Loan relief: Not automatic. Many borrowers may be able to put off mortgage payments for as long as a year. But unlike with student loans, the mortgage forgiveness is not automatic.

Borrowers must first call their mortgage loan servicers to ask for relief. (Note: The servicer is usually the same bank that made your mortgage loan, but not always. Either way, the name of your servicer will be on your monthly bill.)

Servicers who have been asked by borrowers for relief are required to offer a pause in repayment for 90 days at a time. Borrowers can ask to extend the relief up to four times, with no penalties, but they will have to call before the end of each relief period to get extensions.

Who's in: The good news is borrowers don't have to provide any documentation to prove their finances have taken a hit from the coronavirus. Loan servicers are required by the CARES Act to suspend payments with no questions asked. Servicers also are barred from adding any penalties or additional interest if people skip payments.

As with student loans, though, the CARES Act creates a large group of have-nots. The coronavirus relief is only for borrowers with loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federally controlled mortgage giants. Many loans made by private lenders are backed by Fannie and Freddie. (To look up your mortgage, go to Fannie and Freddie's websites, here and here.)

Who's out: About 30% of all mortgage lenders were unable to qualify for the no-questions asked relief from the CARES Act. Most major banks have announced that they will provide mortgage relief as well. But that's not automatic, either. You must first call the bank, and some lenders may require you to prove financial hardship.

Banks may also have different policies about dealing with missed payments once the forgiveness period is up. For instance, Bank of America said it is working with customers, but has not promised to waive interest even if borrowers are allowed to skip payments.

Auto loans

Loan relief: Minimal.

Who's in: No one.

Who's out: Unlike with student loans or mortgages, the federal government does not guarantee auto loans. That means the U.S. can't force auto lenders to suspend payments or call off car repossessions.

As with mortgage loans, though, nearly all of the major lenders have said that they will suspend loan payments for borrowers who call to say they have been affected by the coronavirus.

The good news is that the CARES Act does provide some protection for your credit score. If an auto lender does agree to suspend payments or provide other loan relief, the law prohibits lenders from filing a negative report about the borrower to a credit-rating agency. That only applies to borrowers who were current on their loans as of January 31.

Credit cards

Loan relief: Very little.

Who's in: As with auto loans, the CARES Act essentially offers no relief for credit card borrowers. Many credit card issuers are voluntarily providing relief, but it is only for borrowers who call and ask. Apple Card, American Express and Capital One will allow you to skip a payment without accruing interest, according to CreditCards.com.

Who's out: Credit card debt may end up being a major source of pain for borrowers in the current crisis. Americans collectively owe about about $1 trillion on their credit cards. And most borrowers who skip payments will continue to be charged interest even if a bank says it will waive late fees.","Read on to learn about what kind of debt relief borrowers are getting under the CARES Act.

A recent lawsuit highlights tensions between two federal agencies overseeing the management of student loans.

Font Size: A A A

Americans may soon see a drastic change in how their student loans are serviced.

Student Debt Crisis (SDC), a nonprofit focused on advocacy and educational programming for student borrowers, recently filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the U.S. Department of Education arguing that these agencies have “exacerbated” a student loan crisis, ensnaring valuable initiatives such as the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF).

To address the nation’s growing student debt, Congress in 2007 created PSLF, which offers federal student loan forgiveness to borrowers who make payments over 10 years of public service. Several private loan servicers manage the Education Department’s $1 trillion-plus federal student loan portfolio, which includes PSLF applicants. The largest of these servicers, the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), operates under the name FedLoan Servicing. The Education Department made FedLoan the primary servicer for borrowers working toward PSLF, so PHEAA, a private company, made over $201 million from its servicing of Department loans for the fiscal year ending in June 2019.

Yet the CFPB received over 3,000 PHEAA-related complaints between September 2017 and August 2019 due to its handling of student loans.

Some borrowers reported having trouble convincing their servicers to correct inaccurate records of their qualified payment histories, while others said call centers gave misleading advice in choosing PSLF-compliant repayment plans. In response, Congress authorized a $700 million temporary PSLF expansion (TEPSLF) for borrowers who had made good faith attempts to meet PSLF requirements.

Congress’s expansion of funding brought still more problems. It turns out that the Education Department wanted TEPSLF applicants first to apply for, and be denied, PSLF relief. In effect, borrowers needed to apply for a program they knew they did not qualify for, a confusing requirement that has been shown to be responsible for 71% of TEPSLF denials.

By June 2019, fewer than 1 percent of PSLF applicants had their loans forgiven, and only 4 percent of TEPSLF applicants had any success in reconfiguring their loans. By September, the Education Department had reportedly spent only around $27 million of the $700 million allocated by Congress. According to SDC, these figures demonstrate severe mismanagement of federal student loans.

SDC alleges that the Education Department turned a blind eye to borrower complaints. The nonprofit group argues that its claims are supported by findings from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, and even the Education Department’s Office of Inspector General. The Inspector General concluded in March of last year that the Department “rarely holds servicers accountable” for loan mismanagement. In addition, SDC claims that Congress authorized the CFPB to oversee federal student loan services like PSLF, and that the CFPB’s refusal to do so violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, legislation adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, created the CFPB and granted the agency supervisory authority over “larger participants” in the market for certain consumer financial services. In 2013, the CFPB issued a student loan servicing supervision rule that specified its supervisory powers over large student loan servicers, which SDC argues includes entities like PHEAA because its federally held loans are made pursuant to Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Together, Dodd-Frank and the CFPB’s 2013 rule establish a non-discretionary mandate to regulate public student loans, claims SDC.

In 2018, former CFPB Director Mick Mulvaney announced a new supervision rule stating that the CFPB has supervisory authority over student loans owned by private creditors but not over federally held student loans, a notable policy shift from the Obama Administration.

The 2018 rule is a “material deviation” from the CFPB’s older rule, SDC argues. As a result, SDC claims that CFPB should have undertaken a full notice-and-comment period during which time stakeholders could have voiced concerns about the policy change. SDC further alleges that the CFPB failed to identify the major policy issues prompting the change, stating that the 2018 rule “lacks any explanation of its basis and purpose” and thus violates the APA’s “arbitrary and capricious” clause.

SDC argues that the federal government has even further problems related to oversight of loan servicers. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, two memoranda of understanding (MOUs) established supervisory and oversight cooperation between the CFPB and the Education Department. The MOUs stated that private education loan complaints initially would be directed to the CFPB, while federal loan complaints would go to the Department. The agencies could then exchange nonpublic information to resolve complaints, an exchange on which the CFPB relied to monitor programs like PSLF, states SDC.

But the Education Department unilaterally rescinded the MOUs in 2017, citing the CFPB’s purportedly improper Obama-era expansion of its oversight power by failing to direct complaints for federally held loans to the Department. Current CFPB Director Kathleen Kraninger initially blamed the lack of a replacement MOU on the absence of a director of the agency’s student loan office in charge of coordinating with the Education Department. But former PHEAA executive Robert Cameron has since filled that office, and yet no new MOU has been adopted. The CFPB recognizes that the Dodd-Frank Act requires an information-sharing MOU, and suggests that the Education Department is now blocking that effort.

As a result, SDC asks the court to vacate the 2018 rule, restore the CFPB’s supervisory authority over federally held student loans, and require a Dodd-Frank-compliant MOU between the CFPB and the Education Department.

The court will have to weigh complex issues of agency independence and evaluate the legitimacy of the CFPB’s Obama-era “handshake agreement” granting it primary oversight of public loan servicers. The Department’s steadfast refusal to cooperate with the CFPB on matters not directly related to large loan servicers of federally held funds, in light of the CFPB’s general agreement that it cannot supervise those servicers, adds a layer of complexity to the case.

Dueling narratives about statutory authority will animate potential oral arguments. Can an agency’s ambiguous supervisory power be taken—or interpreted—away? If so, who has the authority to do so: the courts or Congress?

If this case progresses, its outcome could be monumental for students and regulators alike.","Font Size: A A AAmericans may soon see a drastic change in how their student loans are serviced.

184,"pr 1, 2020",Above the Law,How The CARES Act Can Minimize Your Federal Student Loan And Tax Payments - Above the Law,"The recently passed CARES Act included a number of provisions providing tax and student loan relief. And free money. On today’s column, I look at a few pieces of the new legislation that can be used to maximize tax savings and minimize student loan payments for those on IBR and PSLF payment plans.

For 2020 Only: Student Loans Can Be Paid With Pre-Tax Money

For 2020, employers can pay up to $5,250 of an employee’s student loans and it will be tax-free to the employee. Since this is only effective for one year, take advantage of this if you can. The employer must pay the student loan lender directly. It can be paid in a lump sum or can be spread out monthly.

This provision will greatly benefit employees with multiple part-time employers, each of whom can pay up to $5,250 toward their student loans tax free. It will also benefit high-income taxpayers who will not only get a bigger tax break but are also in a better position to pay the full $5,250.

Solo practitioners who have set up a corporation for their practice should have the corporation pay the student loan lender to take advantage of the tax savings. The corporation can take a business deduction for the payment while the solo-shareholder does not have to recognize the payment as W-2 income.

On the other hand, those with lower incomes are likely to be disadvantaged. Because they are in a lower tax bracket, their tax savings will not be as big. Also, most probably work for small firms and their employers may not want to make their payroll more complicated by paying someone other than the employee. And if the employee has no discretionary income after paying for food, shelter, and transportation, they cannot take advantage of this provision at all. Lastly, even if they could, if they have six-figure loans, paying $5,250 spread out over the remaining months of 2020 will barely put a dent on the principal.

I suggest that this provision be integrated with the existing student loan interest deduction and allow a combined maximum student loan (principal and interest) deduction of $7,750.

Should Married Couples File Jointly Or Separately? It’s Even More Complicated

One of the highlights of the bill is that each person will be eligible for a stimulus payment of $1,200. But this payment amount will start to decrease if their adjusted gross income (AGI) as shown on their 2019 tax return (or 2018 tax return if 2019 is not filed yet) is greater than $75,000. The payment will decrease by $5 for every additional $100 of income. If the taxpayer’s AGI exceeds $99,000, they will not be eligible for any payment.

Married couples filing jointly can qualify for the full $2,400 payment if their combined AGI is under $150,000. If their AGI is above $150,000, the payment amount will decrease. And if their AGI is above $198,000, they will not be eligible for any payment. Those filing separately will be treated with the same eligibility rules as single people.

Married couples should file jointly if their combined AGI would qualify them for the full refund as opposed to filing separately. For example, suppose one spouse has an AGI of $90,000 and the other’s AGI is $60,000. If filing separately, the spouse with $90,000 would get a stimulus payment of $450 while the spouse with $60,000 will get the full $1,200 for a total stimulus payment of $1,650. But if filing jointly, they would be eligible for the full $2,400 since their joint income is within the $150,000 limit.

But some couples don’t file jointly even if it results in lower taxes and a larger stimulus payment. This is because doing so will increase their IBR student loan payments and the increase can offset any savings they receive by filing jointly.

Federal Student Loan Payment And Interest Accrual Are Suspended

The CARES Act suspends monthly payments and interest accrual of federal student loans until September 30, 2020. For those on IBR and PSLF repayment plans, even though the payment requirements have been suspended, they will still be treated as if they made timely payments during those months. So those on PSLF should take this blessing and stop making payments immediately until the suspension period is over.

Even for those on other types of payment plans, this gives no incentive to continue making monthly payments. Instead, the money should be saved until the end of the suspension period which could be extended beyond September 30. The saved payments could be used for emergencies. Or they can be used to pay down the loan which includes additional principal.

The suspension of payment and interest accrual does not apply to private loans.

Tax Return Filing Deadline Extensions Can Result In Avoiding Higher IBR Payments for 2019

Lastly, the IRS has extended the tax return filing and payment deadlines until July 15, 2020. An extension to the filing deadline (not payment) is also allowed, which will push the extended due date to January 15, 2021. Most states have followed the IRS’s lead.

This deadline extension is useful for those on IBR or PAYE plans who face higher monthly payments because they will report a higher AGI on their 2019 returns. Since the monthly IBR payment amounts is determined in part by a borrower’s AGI, if the borrower’s 2019 AGI is higher than his or her 2018 AGI, they will be better off filing an extension to push the filing due date to January 15, 2021.

In conjunction with the federal loan payment suspension mentioned above, the borrower will continue to pay the monthly payment based on the lower 2018 income after the suspension period ends so long as the extension is filed. The payments can be lowered after the suspension period if they can prove financial hardship to the lender.

Assuming that the taxpayer will report a lower AGI for 2020, the taxpayer should file an extension and later file the 2019 return on the new January 15, 2021, deadline. The 2020 tax return should then be filed soon thereafter. If done correctly, the borrower could avoid paying the higher 2019 monthly payments or only pay them for a few months before the payments are converted to the lower payments based on the 2020 AGI.

The CARES Act provides some tax and student loan relief to mitigate the economic downturn. With the proper planning, some people who had a very good year in 2019 can save a significant amount of money if they are seeking loan forgiveness through an income-based repayment plan. If possible, it might be best to wait before filing since there is already talk of Phase Four of the CARES Act. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. I’m pretty much quarantined anyway.

185,"pr 1, 2020",Fox Business,5 ways to pay off Parent PLUS Loans fast,"Student loan debts are a financial burden to more than just recent grads. Around 6 percent of total outstanding student loan debt is currently owed by parents facing a collective debt burden of around $87 billion, according to Brookings Institute. And this is just for Parent PLUS loans, not including loans that have been consolidated.

Parent PLUS Loans are federal student loans made to parents to help their kids pay for school and, like other federal loans, they have a fixed interest rate – albeit at a higher annual percentage rate than Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans. In fact, for the 2019-2020 school year, the PLUS Loan rate was 7.08 percent.

If you want to keep interest costs down or become debt-free as soon as possible, you may want to repay your PLUS Loans fast. If that's your goal, these five tips for debt relief can help.

1. Choose the right repayment plan

Parents have multiple repayment plan options, including a standard plan that will result in loans being repaid over 10 years or an extended repayment plan that stretches repayment out over as long as 25 years. With an extended plan, monthly payments are smaller but it takes you far longer to be free of debt -- and you pay much higher total interest costs.

2. Consider refinancing

Private refinance loans can sometimes offer a lower interest rate than PLUS Loans, especially if you have good credit and sufficient income to repay what you've borrowed. This process means finding a private lender and taking out a loan to repay existing debts. Most often, these refinance loans come from online lenders, credit unions or banks.

PARENT PLUS LOANS: WHO QUALIFIES AND HOW TO REFINANCE THEM

Refinancing means giving up options for income-driven repayment or loan forgiveness as well as giving up other federal loan benefits such as generous forbearance policies. But if you won't take advantage of these benefits anyway, refinancing can make a lot of sense.

If you can reduce your interest rate when you refinance your loan, repayment will cost less because a smaller portion of your monthly payment goes to interest. If your interest rate and payment decline after refinancing but you keep making the same size payment, you'll get your principal balance paid down quickly.

You also have the option to refinance to a new loan with a shorter repayment term. Often, you'll get the most competitive rate by choosing a short-term loan. And while your monthly payments will be bigger, you'll be able to pay off your debt much faster.

For example, if you have a $10,000 PLUS Loan at 7.08 percent and have eight years left on repayment, refinancing to a new loan at 4.99 percent interest with a five-year repayment term would raise your monthly payment by about $52 a month but you'd be free of your debt three years sooner and would save over $1,800 in interest.

3. Make extra monthly payments

Even a small extra payment can make a big difference in how long it takes to pay off what you owe. If you have a $10,000 loan at 7.08 percent and you pay an extra $100 a month starting from your second payment, you could repay your debt 5.4 years sooner and save over $2,236 in interest costs.

IS IT SMART TO MAKE INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS ON STUDENT LOANS?

4. Skip the deferment period

Parents can defer repayment on PLUS Loans while children are in school and during a six-month post-graduation deferment. But interest doesn't stop accruing while loans are deferred.

In fact, if you've borrowed $10,000 at 7.08 percent and you defer repayment for 12 months, you'll accrue $708 in unpaid interest that gets added to your loan balance.

You'll end up paying interest on this added interest so repayment will be costlier. Since your monthly payments will be higher due to your larger balance, making extra payments will be more difficult.

WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDENT LOANS IN DIVORCE?

5. Take advantage of Public Service Loan Forgiveness

PLUS Loans are a type of federal student aid, so parents get many of the same borrower protections as student borrowers. However, parents don't have access to income-driven repayment or Public Service Loan Forgiveness without first consolidating using a Direct Consolidation Loan.

Consolidation is free and you can consolidate even a single loan via a quick online application. Once you've consolidated, you can repay your debt using Income Contingent Repayment and you can become eligible for loan forgiveness for qualifying public service work after making 120 payments while working for the government or for an eligible non-profit.","And this is just for Parent PLUS loans, not including loans that have been consolidated.

186,"pr 1, 2020",Inside Higher Ed,Progressives were divided over widespread cancellation of student debt in stimulus,"Three Tuesdays ago, in a building on New York University’s campus, Robert Shireman, director of higher education excellence and senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, was supposed to be part of a debate over whether the government should cancel student debt.

Shireman, a skeptic of the idea, was supposed to go up against one of the leading advocates of the idea, Alexis Goldstein, senior policy analyst at the advocacy group Americans for Financial Reform, as part of series of debates sponsored by NYU's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

It was a simpler time, before social distancing and hospitals overflowing with coronavirus patients. In just the three weeks since, the world has changed. The subject of that night’s purely academic debate would reach the halls of Congress, with stakes much bigger than the bragging rights after a debate.

Dozens of left-of-center advocates and higher education policy experts privately engaged in their own debate over debt cancellation, divided by such questions as whether a policy, in which wealthy college graduates would be among those who’d benefit, was a high priority right now.

In a mood those participating in the conversations described as complex, the issue would also include such questions as the racial disparity in being able to go to college.

The conversations occurred in the rush of a nation trying to deal with the coronavirus crisis socially and politically.

The NYU debate, March 10, ended up being canceled “due to the evolving health and travel concerns around COVID-19,” the organizers said.

Three days later, on March 13, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency as fears of the coronavirus crisis sent the stock market into a dive.

Four days after that, as Congress was finishing up a second stimulus bill that provided for more paid family leave, and starting work on what would be the $2 trillion package signed into law Friday -- and though it would be no easy sell in the Republican-controlled Senate -- advocates hurriedly began trying to figure out among themselves to what extent they thought debt cancellation should be a priority.

By that time, all were working from home, and in a series of conference calls and emails, with pets and infants in the background, it was clear that even among progressives, there’s a wide range of opinions about the idea of the government simply canceling student debt.

“We met by phone because we’re all on lockdown,” said Ashley Harrington, federal advocacy director at the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer group supportive of large-scale debt cancellation, who was involved in the conversation.

Shireman and others interviewed said they wouldn’t describe the discussions as heated. “Nobody’s been fighting -- it was more an acknowledgment that there’s a range of views among progressive organizations about how far to go in terms of student loan relief,” he said.

Still, there are strong feelings on both sides.

Some progressives, like Shireman, said they remain concerned that widespread debt cancellation, which some groups are urging, doesn’t target those most in need.

One participant who was involved in the conversation noted that proposals by House and Senate Democrats would involve the federal government making monthly student loan payments for those with federal loans and would guarantee their balances would be reduced by at least $10,000.

Those getting the relief would also get the $1,200 payment in the stimulus package, or a lesser amount based on a sliding scale if they make more than $75,000 annually, that participant noted.

“We’re talking about an additional $10,000 for people who had the good fortune to go to college. People who didn’t have that opportunity, and may have been laid off, only get $1,200,” said the person. Like some involved in the discussions, they agreed to be interviewed on the condition they not be named because of the sensitivities around discussing conversations between the groups.

“There’s a little bit of a tension on the left over whether we should push cancellation,” another said. “For some, debt cancellation is a big policy priority of theirs, and [the stimulus package] is a way to push that viewpoint.”

“Other nerdy wonk folks actually want to have an impact on putting money back into people’s pockets,” the second person said.

“My family doesn’t need loan relief,” Shireman said. “It should be more narrowly targeted to those based on need,” he said, citing those who are in debt after being misled by a for-profit institution about the chances of getting a well-paying job after graduation.

“It’s not a high priority to provide loan relief to lawyers and doctors who are continuing their jobs at the same salaries,” he said.

But Goldstein argued that even if cancellation helped some with higher incomes, the $10,000 of relief would mean the most to lower-income borrowers, freeing those who owe less than that from having to keep making payments. Trying to target cancellation based on income would be complicated to design and administer. Congress could always make adjustments to make the policy less regressive in the future by adjusting the tax code.

“Honestly, what I think,” Harrington said, “is that the complaints about cancellation being regressive doesn’t acknowledge there are very big differences in terms of income and wealth. I get a little frustrated because the argument doesn’t acknowledge that making an income of $80,000 goes a lot further for one person than another.”

Some making a higher income might be helping support their parents. Some African Americans with graduate degrees believe they needed the additional education just to be able to compete for jobs with white people with only bachelor's degrees. And others, despite making higher incomes, had to take on more debt than others because their parents didn’t make enough to help pay for college.

Even skeptics of broad loan cancellation, like Matthew Chingos, the Urban Institute’s vice president for education data and policy, said racial disparity in being able to afford college is a legitimate point. There’s an argument to be made to base loan cancellation on race, but it would likely run into legal and political problems, he said.

Progressives differ on how much canceling student debt would stimulate an economy buckling from business closures and layoffs during the pandemic.

Chingos, in a blog post last week, argued that those who’d get more money, either through cancellation or the six-month, interest-free suspension of most borrowers having to make payments in the stimulus bill Congress ultimately passed last week, are those well-off enough to have signed up to make the highest payments each month.

Only two-thirds of those with student loan debt in 2016, according to the most recent data available, were making payments on their loans and would have extra cash during a pause, the analysis said Thursday.

Ninety percent of the highest-income households were paying down their loans, while only 30 percent of the lowest-income households were making payments and would have extra money by not having to make loan payments.

“It’s hard to make the argument that loan cancellation would help put money in the pockets of the people struggling with debt,” he said in an interview.

But others, like Kyle Southern, policy and advocacy director for higher education and workforce for the advocacy group Young Invincibles, argue that other studies have shown loan cancellation would increase the nation’s GDP and create jobs. A 2018 paper from the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College called for the federal government to wipe away all $1.5 trillion in federal student loan debt, arguing it would stimulate the overall economy. That paper acknowledged that the largest loan balances are held by the highest earners but said that the degree to which student debt is held by high earners has diminished.

Particularly for young people, knowing that their balances are decreasing even if they don’t have to make payments would give them the peace of mind to spend money, including their stimulus checks, now. Otherwise, Southern said, they’d hold on to the money for when they would have to make payments again, particularly because it might take time to find jobs as the economy slowly gears back up after the crisis.

Ultimately, most of the groups, including Goldstein’s Americans for Financial Reform and Young Invincibles, ended up backing proposals by Democrats in the House and the Senate, guaranteeing at least $10,000 of relief.

The House Democrats’ proposal would have also made payments each month of those with private student loans, guaranteeing up to $10,000 of relief.

An aide on the Democrat-controlled House Education and Labor Committee disputed the $10,000 of relief was a “compromise” figure. Rather, Democrats in both houses chose it, the aide said, because the majority of borrowers who are so struggling with their loans that they go into default have just under $10,000 worth of debt.

“By setting the number at $10,000, we are alleviating borrowers who are most in need,” the aide said.

But several people involved in the discussion between progressive groups viewed the $10,000 figure as a compromise. Some groups who wanted more cancellation were willing to accept it, while others with reservations could live with it as well.

Young Invincibles has backed Democratic Massachusetts senator and former Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren’s plan, which would go much further than the Democratic proposals -- forgiving $50,000 of debt for those making less than $100,000. Those making between $100,000 to $200,000 would have had less debt forgiven, based on a sliding scale. But they too backed the $10,000 cancellation, as an improvement over Republican plans to put in law the Trump administration’s executive order deferring payments without interest.

A representative of one group said they preferred Congress take a more nuanced approach that targeted people of color and low-income borrowers instead of ""the blunt instrument."" But given the hurry to put a stimulus bill together, and the fact that some low-income borrowers and people of color would no doubt benefit, they were willing to go along with it.

Some other groups, like Education Reform Now, though, decided to stay neutral on the debt cancellation provisions of the bill, also favoring a more targeted approach. “We'd like to see 100 percent forgiveness of those ripped off by for-profits and bad-actor, high-priced colleges with unconscionably high dropout rates,” emailed Michael Dannenberg, the group’s director of strategic initiatives for policy.

Ultimately, no debt relief was included in the bill. Advocates like Goldstein say the differing views among progressives were less a factor than strong Republican objection to the idea. Republican senators had voiced some of the same misgivings as some progressives.

“Democrats are trying to reduce student loans by $10,000. What the hell has that got to do with the virus?” Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, told Fox News on March 22, as the $2 trillion package was being negotiated.

Instead the bill excuses most borrowers from making payments for six months, interest-free, and bars collection agencies from garnishing wages, tax refunds and Social Security benefits.

Southern said he believes there is broad consensus, though, that the bill doesn’t go far enough and most groups support canceling debt in some form. “That's why I said after the Senate’s passage that Congress had met its absolute base responsibility of doing no immediate harm. That's all pushing loan payments down the road will do,” he said.

It’s unclear where the conversation between the groups goes from here. With the Senate and House on recess until at least April 20, Chingos said it buys time to come up with a more targeted approach to canceling loans.

But one who was involved in the discussions said, “It seems like people have gone to their separate camps.”

Shireman, though, said groups are just now starting to talk about how to move forward after last week’s debate over the $2 trillion bill. “I think we’re all just coming up for air after the craziness of last week. It was just insane. I never needed a weekend more in my life,” he said.","“Nobody’s been fighting -- it was more an acknowledgment that there’s a range of views among progressive organizations about how far to go in terms of student loan relief,” he said.
Some progressives, like Shireman, said they remain concerned that widespread debt cancellation, which some groups are urging, doesn’t target those most in need.
There’s an argument to be made to base loan cancellation on race, but it would likely run into legal and political problems, he said.
Progressives differ on how much canceling student debt would stimulate an economy buckling from business closures and layoffs during the pandemic.

In order to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. government has suspended all federal student loan payments and halted all interest charges, through Sept. 30, as part of the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package enacted into law March 27. [Updated Aug. 9, 2021: The forbearance has been extended until Jan. 31, 2022]

The unprecedented action follows the Department of Education’s earlier announcement that all collections and garnishments on federal student loans in default will come to a stop, a move that will now also run through the end of September.

Likewise, anyone who recently had their income tax refund, Social Security check or other federal payment garnished due to defaulted loans will now get that money back, the Department of Education said. You can find more details on other provisions of the rescue package in our news wrap.

While the suspension could offer significant help to those with federal loans — most U.S. college loans are federal, including roughly 83% of student debt held by the Class of 2018 — the government offered no immediate relief for private student loans.

Still, some private lenders are also offering help to borrowers suffering financial difficulties, and those with private student debt are advised to check in with their lender to see what’s available.

No mass forgiveness, at least for now

Something not included in the economic rescue act was direct forgiveness of student debt, federal or otherwise. A March 25 report from Inside Higher Ed said some lawmakers had urged offering a set dollar amount of student loan forgiveness, with Senate Democrats proposing $10,000 or more in relief per borrower.

On the other hand, the government may come out with additional economic measures in the future, depending on how deeply the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak impacts the economy.

188,"ar 30, 2020",401K Specialist,Student Loan Repayment Benefit Added Under Cares Act,"The $2.2 trillion Cares Act stimulus bill President Trump signed into law Friday includes required minimum distribution and early withdrawal penalty waivers directly related to 401ks, but it also includes a new student loan repayment benefit for employees that can help them start saving for retirement earlier.

Under the provision, an employer may contribute up to $5,250 annually toward an employee’s student loans, and such payment would be excluded from the employee’s income. The $5,250 cap applies to both the new student loan repayment benefit as well as other educational assistance (e.g., tuition, fees, books) provided by the employer under current law.

The provision applies to any student loan payments made by an employer on behalf of an employee after date of enactment and before January 1, 2021. Full details can be found in section 2206 of the bill.

The provision stems from a bipartisan proposal that has been circulating on Capitol Hill for the last few years. Tax relief for employer-sponsored student loan repayment was introduced by Reps. Rodney Davis (R-IL) and Scott Peters (D-CA) and Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA) and John Thune (R-SD) as the Employer Participation in Repayment Act.

While some critics have said it will provide new tax benefits to financially secure, well-off borrowers who don’t need the help, the legislation had strong industry support from those looking to help employees repay their student debt. Goodly and Tuition.io, a pair of companies focused on tackling the employee student loan debt issue, both reached out to 401k Specialist to discuss this aspect of the bill.

Both companies praised Congress for passing the coronavirus stimulus bill and its inclusion of the tax break for student loan payments made by employers.

“We applaud the government stimulus bill for including a provision on income tax exclusion for individuals who are receiving student loan repayment assistance from their employer,” said Scott Thompson CEO, Tuition.io. “Providing a tax subsidy for employer student loan repayment doesn’t just benefit individual workers, it will help reduce a major drag on the overall economy as we recover from the COVID-19 shock. Even if only temporary, this groundbreaking legislation will enable companies large and small to help America’s working people make it through this historical crisis.”

Gregory Poulin, co-founder and CEO of Goodly, a San Francisco-based tech company that partners with employers to offer student loan repayment as an employee benefit, called employer-sponsored student loan repayment a “win-win” for employees and the economy.

“As we’re witnessing the worst national health crisis in more than 100 years and unprecedented economic volatility, one key to supporting employees is to help with their student loans and the Cares Act provides employers a powerful opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the financial wellbeing of their employees,” Poulin told 401k Specialist.

Poulin, whose passion for the issue came from his own personal experience with student loans (“After my father passed away unexpectedly, I had to borrow $80k to pay for my education at Dartmouth. My monthly payment is now $900,” he says), adds that 63% of U.S. employers already provide some level of tax-free tuition assistance, which allows their employees to receive up to $5,250 per year toward qualified education expenses.

“The Cares Act simply amends Section 127 of the tax code to incorporate provisions of The Employer Participation in Repayment Act. This provision of the Cares Act allows employers to pay up to $5,250 of an employee’s student loan debt on a tax-free basis,” Poulin says.

The provision “levels the playing field and makes access to tax-free employer education assistance fair and equitable for all employees,” he says.

Poulin reiterates it is important to remember that $5,250 is a combined limit, meaning employers that offer tuition reimbursement and student loan repayment programs have a cap of tax-free support at $5,250 per employee.

“And, most importantly, employer contributions toward student loans must be made by January 1, 2021 for those payments to be tax exempt,” Poulin says. “Payments made before the enactment of the Cares Act or after January 1, 2021, by the employer toward their employees student loan will be counted as taxable income for the employee.”

Addressing the problem

The burden of student loans has topped $1.6 trillion, with the average individual holding nearly $30,000 of debt. That’s more than the total credit card debt or total auto loan debt, according to the New York Federal Reserve.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the effect on borrowers was profound with many putting off major life milestones such as saving for retirement or buying a house. In 2019, more than 11 million Americans were past due or in default on a student loan.

The impact of COVID-19 on the economy has been swift and unprecedented, further stifling workers and employers who were already feeling the pressure of financial stress.

The new legislation takes effect immediately, and companies like Goodly and Tuition.io are eager to help employers act quickly to bring student loan repayment benefits and support to employees already feeling the stress.

Goodly has seen an unprecedented increase in demand from employers looking for ways to support their employees with student loans during the COVID-19 outbreak, Goodly says, and in response, the company is offering its platform for free for new clients for three months.

Poulin says he is “extremely confident” Congress will act to make the Employer Participation in Repayment Act permanent, noting how the bill has 64 co-sponsors in the Senate and 270 in the House, and that President Trump has said he will sign it into law if Congress passes it.

Six-month pause on payments

In addition to the Cares Act’s student loan repayment benefit for employees, the bill also includes a provision that borrowers will not have to make any student loan payments for six months (through Sept. 30, 2020) on federal student loans.

This extends the two-month pause that President Trump had previously announced for student loan payments.

While the loans will have to be repaid, interest during the six-month period will be waived entirely. Only certain federal student loans are eligible; private student loans are not eligible.

Involuntary collection of defaulted student loans, including wage garnishment and claiming of tax refunds, will also be suspended under the Cares Act.","The $5,250 cap applies to both the new student loan repayment benefit as well as other educational assistance (e.g., tuition, fees, books) provided by the employer under current law.

189,"ar 29, 2020",Wall Street Journal,Stimulus Package Brings Relief to Most Student-Loan Borrowers,"WASHINGTON—The economic-stimulus package signed by President Trump on Friday offers relief for most of the 43 million Americans who owe a total of $1.5 trillion in federal student debt.

The bill allows most borrowers to stop making monthly payments through Sept. 30, with no financial penalties. Interest will be suspended, so each borrower’s balance will freeze, and the account will remain in good standing.

The bill covers student loans made directly by the federal government and a portion of those made by private lenders and guaranteed by the government under a program that ended in 2010. However, loans made under the federal guarantee program that are held by commercial institutions won’t qualify.

The typical family spends $179 a month on payments, according to a July 2019 report by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The Institute for College Access and Success, a student advocacy group, estimates that the suspension of payments will free up some $50 billion for families over roughly six months.

The bill goes further than a policy that President Trump announced earlier this month to allow borrowers to suspend payments for two months, interest-free. Administration officials said federal law empowered the administration to make the change without congressional approval, but some education experts, such as a financial-aid consultant Mark Kantrowitz, questioned the administration’s legal authority.

Congressional Democrats had pushed unsuccessfully for a provision in the stimulus bill to reduce each federal borrower’s balance by at least $10,000 while suspending payments.

In one sense, the bill forgives a portion of debt for some borrowers. The roughly six months of foregone payments would count as on-time payments for borrowers enrolled in programs that forgive debt after a period.

For example, government and nonprofit workers hoping to take advantage of a program called “public service loan forgiveness” must make 120 monthly payments before balances are forgiven. The six months of nonpayments under the stimulus bill would count toward those 120 payments.

The stimulus bill also provides a temporary incentive for employers to pay down their workers’ student-loan balances. Employers would be able to contribute up to $5,250 toward each worker’s student debt through Dec. 31 without any tax consequences for the employee. That would in effect give the employee a tax-free raise, because normally such contributions would be treated as taxable income.

Supporters say that provision will shift some education costs to companies from individuals, freeing up money for families. Critics, including higher-education expert Jason Delisle of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and some progressives, say it would favor higher-paid workers at big companies that offer generous benefits over lower-paid workers at companies that don’t offer them.

Few employers offer student-loan assistance, though the number is rising. Eight percent of employers surveyed by the Society for Human Resource Management in April 2019 offered assistance with student loans, up from 4% in 2018 and 3% in 2015.

190,"ar 27, 2020",MarketWatch,$2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package lets some student-loan borrowers delay payments for six months,"Student-loan borrowers struggling to make payments as the coronavirus cripples parts of the U.S. economy will get a temporary break under the $2.2 trillion stimulus package President Donald Trump signed into law on Friday.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act lets student-loan borrowers take a six month break from making payments on their federally-backed student loans.

Until Sept. 30, borrowers will not be penalized for late payments. The CARES Act extends a two-month pause that President Donald Trump announced for student-loan payments last week. The federal stimulus bill will also hand out $1,200 checks to people under certain income limits, expand unemployment benefits, and provide relief to small businesses.

The temporary break on student-loan payments includes borrowers seeking to have their student loan debt forgiven through the Public Student Loan Forgiveness Program. That program allows borrowers who work in certain public or nonprofit sector jobs to have their federal student loan debt erased after making on-time payments for 10 years.

The CARES Act would allow them and other federal student loan borrowers to delay payments without facing an interest penalty. The zero-interest deferment option, if a student’s federal loan policy qualifies, will be automatically applied.

“Those people will just have to do what they’re normally doing,” said Travis Hornsby, founder of Student Loan Planner, a student loan repayment advisory group based in Saint Louis, Missouri. “Since many people unfortunately ignore their payment plans they just continue to ignore it but won’t have to pay interest [over the six month period].”

Borrowers aren’t off the hook for any portion of their student loan debt burden. Some were hopeful that Democratic lawmakers would be able to pass a provision to cancel $10,000 in student debt per borrower over the course of the coronavirus-related national emergency.

One important caveat to the bill: private student loan borrowers don’t get any relief at all from this bill, Hornsby said. The six-month break only applies to people with federally-backed loans. “That’s really unfortunate for people who converted their federal loan to private to pay back debt,” he added. “the rug got pulled out from under them.”

That includes approximately 6 million loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan program that are held by commercial lenders, according to Student Loan Planner’s calculations based on data from the Dept. of Education.

Allowing borrowers to delay loan payments “is like a Band-aid on a deep wound, the underlying situation remains unresolved,” said Andrew Housser, co-CEO of Freedom Financial Network, an online debt management company based in San Mateo, Calif.

Currently Americans collectively owe $1.5 trillion in outstanding student loan debt — that’s more than the total credit card debt as well as total auto debt, according to the New York Federal Reserve. 11.1% of total student debt is more than 90 days delinquent.

“Helping people mitigate the cycle of debt, especially those with crushing student debt, will help alleviate some of the pain of this sudden crisis, and importantly, will help people rebound once we have the crisis under control,” Housser said. “We don’t know when this will end, but we do know that when it does we need people to get back to work and start spending again in order to reinvigorate the economy.”

He added, “There is much more that should be done for student borrowers once this crisis is over, but this will help, no question.”

In addition to student-loan debt relief, the Senate agreed to create a $30.75 billion education stabilization fund, approximately 46% of which would be directed to colleges. $13 billion would go to primary and secondary school. Additionally the fund would provide grants to “local educational agencies that the State educational agency deems have been most significantly impacted by coronavirus,” the bill states.","The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act lets student-loan borrowers take a six month break from making payments on their federally-backed student loans.

191,"ar 27, 2020",NJ.com,"Feds offer student loan relief, but some N.J. borrowers are left behind","Theresa Hofmann, who holds two degrees from prestigious universities, pays more than her rent each month to cover student loans from the federal government and NJCLASS.

The Somerville, Massachusetts, divorce attorney only pays about $300 a month to the federal government, but said her monthly payments on the NJCLASS loans top $1,400 — after she refinanced.

“If it were just me, I’d probably be fine,” said Hofmann, who is originally from West Milford. “But I want to help my mom. Right now, I have no leftover money.”

The coronavirus outbreak has plunged New Jersey and the nation into an economic crisis and turned stable industries upside down overnight. To help those struggling, President Donald Trump has set the interest rate for federally-held student loans to 0%. He also created an option that allows any borrower to request forbearance and pause payments for two months, and that timeframe could soon be extended to six months.

But NJCLASS loans, distributed by the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA), are not funded by the federal government or New Jersey taxpayer money, but by bondholders. They offer lower competitive rates compared to many private lenders, and borrowers can pay them back over 10 or 20 years.

So far, they and other private loans are not included in the relief efforts.

For attending The Catholic University of America in D.C. and then Boston University for law school, Hofmann, 26, still owes $179,472 in NJCLASS loans alone. She graduated last May, and has not had much time to save while making monthly payments.

If she could hit pause on NJCLASS loans for six months, she could breathe a sigh of relief, knowing she would have an extra $1,700 each month should her family need help.

“That would be huge,” Hofman said. “That would be better than anything that Congress would give me” for federal loans.

The $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by the U.S. Senate, and expected to be voted on by the House, would suspend payments automatically for any student loan held by the federal government. There was at least one U.S. House draft that included a provision that would help private, and therefore NJCLASS, loan holders.

In a statement, HESAA said it “is committed to helping all borrowers, including those in need of relief from making payments as they cope with the current emergency.”

But halting student payments to NJCLASS loans isn’t simple. Without an alternate source of income, like federal assistance, the bonds would go into default.

The authority said it has reached out to New Jersey’s Congressional delegation to voice its support of payment relief for NJCLASS borrowers. It said it has never charged borrowers late fees for payments, and will continue that policy.

By August of last year, borrowers held 130,002 outstanding NJCLASS loans, totaling $1,767,981,091 in principle, according to an annual report from HESAA. Around 40% of borrowers come from families that make between $40,000 and $80,000 a year, the middle of New Jersey’s middle class.

On March 19, HESAA and Gov. Phil Murphy said the authority would allow those directly impacted by the economic downturn to apply for loan relief for temporary disability or unemployment, or financial hardship relief.

But those efforts do not take a sweeping approach like the one applied to federal loans.

When asked Wednesday on WCBS Radio 880-AM what he planned to do regarding student loan relief, Murphy said: “We’re looking very hard at that.""

He did not provide specifics.

Senate President Stephen Sweeney also called for relief for private loan borrowers from the federal government, along with a two-month pause on mortgage, home equity, loan, utility and insurance payments.

“Now, more than ever, we need a moratorium on student loan payments from HESSA for current students, graduates who carry debt and their families whose lives and finances are being disrupted by the coronavirus crisis,"" he said Thursday in a statement.

But he also said the state should make it a priority, too, by enacting consistent policy following federal action.

“We have to consider the impact on bondholders, but we also have to understand that these conditions can be catastrophic for student borrowers as well,"" he said.
